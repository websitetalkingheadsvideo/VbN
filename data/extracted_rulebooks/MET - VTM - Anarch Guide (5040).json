Firefighters are still \nclearing the scene, but it looks like a total loss.” \n“How did it happen?” Her eyes never left the young musician, who had switched \nfrom painfully exquisite classical guitar to a rollicking blues number. \n“According to our sources in the eighth precinct, witnesses are telling police \nthat a gang of men in ‘punk‘ clothes burst through the door, assaulted the maitrC’d \nand ordered the staff and the customers to leave. Then they spread some kind of \naccelerant over the restaurant, shouted something about ‘death to all fascists’ and ran \nout of the building. A few seconds later there was a loud explosion and the (entire \nplace went up in flames.’’ \n“It sounds like their work, but how can we be sure it wasn’t just some kine of \nsimilar disposition?” Her words were quiet, measured, without a hint of irritation. \n“These things can happen, even in our fair city.” \n“I asked our sources that too, ma’am. They passed along this information, which \nat my request they’ve agreed to keep out of the press. There was a message this time.” \nHe produced a paper from his pocket and handed it to her.

When she looked up, the room was quiet, several sets of unblinking eyes \ntrained on her. \n‘‘I assume you all heard what just happened,” she said wryly. \n“Damn right we did!” An intense-looking young man with several body \npiercings and a number of prominent tattoos rose from his chair and began pacing \nnervously around the room. “They’re going to ruin everything!” In his corner, a \nnumber of nearly identical gang members murmured noises of agreement. \n“They don’t understand how this system works,” the guitarist concurred, setting \ndown his instrument and settling back comfortably into the embrace of several \nbeautiful, vacant-eyed female admirers. “We have been more than reasonable about \nallowing them a chance to find a place in the city before, but now.. .” He shrugged. \n“Something must be done. As always, though,” he nodded deferentially to the young \nwoman, “we’ll follow your lead, Miss D.” \nAll eyes turned to back to the young woman, waiting. At last she said: “I think \nwe know what has to be done. They’ve overstepped their authority after repeated \nwarnings, and there’s only one punishment I can think of for that: It’s time we called \nthe Saracen and had him take care of it.” She looked around for signs of disapproval, \nfound none, and nodded once. “It’s decided.” \n“This problem ends tonight.” \n“. . . So then1 heard this story from CitizenTop, this crazy asshole over in the UK. \nHe has this theory that ‘Clan Toreador’ doesn’t really exist - \nit’s all just a big \nMalkavian prank!” Rick paused, the din of the pounding techno in the background \nunderscoring his words. “Yeah, he says that every stinkin’ one of them he’s ever met \nis really a Setite, or a Caitiff, or some other weirdo trying to pass themselves off as one \nof the Degenerates, and he ain’t met an actual Degenerate yet, so it must be some kind \nof big Lunatic joke!” \nA1 threw his head back from the neck of one of the pretty young things they’d \npicked up and laughed loudly along with the others. He sounded almost as drunk as \nhis giggling vessel. “Hey Carver, aren’t you supposed to have been one of those Tory \nAdores back in the day? You wanna set our boy Rick straight?” \nCarver turned and glared from his post by the rickety front door. “Leave me \nalone, guys, I’m on watch.” He twirled his favorite silver knife absently in one hand \nas he watched the party, dancing it across his fingers almost faster than the human \neye could follow. \n“For what?” Rick yelled back, still laughing. “You think those stuffy bastards are \ngonna take us on after the number we did on their place tonight? Damn, man, they \nwouldn’t have the nuts to come at this place with so many witnesses around, \nespecially in such a ghetto ‘hood like this.

Knights uber alles!” A1 saluted the air with \nan upraised fist, followed immediately by Rick and the other Knights. “Hell, yeah!” \nthey chorused in unison, and then the victory party revved back to a deafening, \n7 roar. \n“Idiots,” Carver muttered, grinning just slightly. His smile faltered ab-ruptly \nwhen he realized that he hadn’t felt his knife in his hand for several momeni:s and \nhadn’t heard it hit the floor either. Turning back to the door, he had just enough time \nto register the shadowy form advancing on him before the knife sliced down in asilver \narc. His head flew free, a look of surprise still written across its features. \nIt was more warning than the others had. \nOnly moments later a thoroughly unremarkable individual walked calmly but \npurposefully away from the house and vanished into thenight. Inside, the first sparkscaught \nand the dull orange glow began seeping through the windows as the fire flared into life. \n. . .  \n‘‘. . . Is this what you call justice?Half adozen ofour fellow anarchs and their mortal \nfriends murdered in their home, for the sake of a single restaurant?’’ In life, I3ailey \nCarlton had been a political scientist with a compelling talent for public speaking; in \nundeath, his speeches were rapidly becoming known throughout the Movement for \ntheir power and revolutionary fire. Sure enough, no sooner had he finished his latest \nquestion than an explosive roar of No’s and Hell No’s erupted from the crowd. \n“All the Knights ever asked for is what any of the rest of us want - \na place to \ncall our own, a place where we can be free to feed as we choose and dictate the way \nwe run our own unlives in peace.” Bailey slammed a fist on the podium, his own \noutrage rising along with the crowd. “I ask you, Prince Elena, why did the Knights \nhave to die for your petty territoriality?” Bailey’s voice suddenly rose to an accusation \nthat sounded more like the thunder of avengeful god to the ears of his audience. “Why \ndid you have to kill to keep them silent?” \nJust beyond the back of the crowd a small knot of individuals had gathered, their \nleather jackets and rebellious symbols blending in with the rest of the rowdy throng even \nif the looks in their eyes did not. “The kid really is excellent,” remarked one off-hancledly \nas the crowd gave another primal howl of agreement. “I gotta admit, I’m impressed. Only \nsix days after the fact, and he’s already drawn at least three dozen strong.” \n“Better than we could’ve hoped,” agreed another of the group, crossing his \nheavily tattooed arms as though to ward off the noise. “Almost too good, actually. \nThey’re going crazy out there.” \n“Best to make the call now, then. The sooner this is over with, the better we all \ncome out of it.” At that, one of the group broke off, threaded through the sparse crowd \nof toughs by the back door and flipped open a cell phone as he walked out into the \nnight, leaving the din of the crowd behind him. \nA few words later, the last play of the plan was underway. \nhLUDL: SACRIFICES \n1 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

I can assure you that they won’t \nbe satisfied with the usual ‘be patient and we’ll get to you someday’ crap that we’ve \ngotten in the past.’’ \n“Are you threatening me?” Elena meant the words to sound low and ominous, \nbut there it was, just a hint of anxiety. That was all Daron needed to see - \nthis battle \nwas over in every way except the negotiation of the cease-fire terms. \n“It’s not my fault you stepped in it deep, and truth be told it’s not my job to \nprotect you from the consequences either. Right now most of my people want to light \nthis city up and your crew along with it, and let’s be honest here. We both know that \nif I let things get ugly right now, your sheriff and his goons couldn’t handle the \nnumbers we’ve mustered. Even if you got lucky and managed to hold us off, you’d be \nso weak that I’m sure Bishop Santiago up the river would just love to make a grab for \nthe city.” Daron let this sink in for a moment, and when Elena said nothing, she \ncontinued. “On the other hand, with just a little effort I can disperse the worst of these \ntroublemakers, and not only save you a lot of grief but also keep Santiago from daring \nto make a move in the bargain.” \n“And what would 1 owe you for this generous favor?” Elena’s word dripped \nsarcasm, but her eyes were defeated. \n“Full feeding rights and territorial autonomy, for my own group and the other \nestablished anarch packs in the city. We stay out of your business, agree to police our \nown people, and in return you consent to stop the scourge from bothering any of us \never again.” Daron flashed a victorious smile. “DO we have a deal?” \nElena stewed for a moment, just long enough to save face, then shook her head \nsadly. “Against my better judgment, I will agree to honor your terms, rather than risk \nthe safety of my city at the hands of the Sword of Caine.” \nDaron and her small entourage rose to leave, Sam zipping his guitar back into \nits case while Shane gestured for his waiting gang ghouls to bring him his jacket. As \nthey were stepping through the door, Elena called after them: “Awfully convenient, \nthose little bastards getting killed so soon after they burned my restaurant down, \ndon’t you think? Couldn’t have worked out better for you if you’d planned it.” \nDaron turned in the doorway, her face and voice absolutely neutral. “Every one \nof us swears to die for the cause if that’s what it takes to achieve the goals of the \nMovement. It’s just that not everybody gets to choose when they’ll be called on to \nactually do it.” With that, she closed the door, leaving Elena alone with her troubled \nthoughts and her troubled city. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDL \n8 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Kindred of all kinds follow the banner of the Anarch Revolt, from fiery \nrabble-rousers and passionate intellectuals to zealous warriors and cunning infiltra- \ntors.

Revolution is here - \nthe only question now \nis whether you’re in or you’re out. \nBefore we get into the history of the anarchs and the unique culture and talents \nthey’ve developed, however, a few additional concerns need addressing. Please take \na moment and repeat after me: \nThis book is about a game that involves fictional characters in a fictional setting. It \nis not a terrorist handbook, and I am not a revolutionary.

As \nsuch, even well-meaning and responsible players can accidentally attract a lot of \nunwanted attention for actions or remarks that wouldn’t have raised an eyebrow a few \nyears back. When you combine this new heightened sensitivity with the fact that you \nare playing a game that also involves costumes, lingo and behavior that most normal \npeople don’t understand to begin with, things can very easily be taken out of context \nin a negative way. Hotel security probably won’t stop to ask if you’re playing a game \nbefore kicking you out when other guests report that you and your friends in the lobby \nare discussing building bombs, and the diner staff may feel quite justified in calling the \npolice when they overhear those guys in fatigues discussing how to move a load of \nautomatic weapons into the city. And let’s not start to think about what even open- \nminded parents might do these days if they hear their kid talking to those weird-looking \nnew friends about planning a violent “raid” of any kind.. . \nStorytellers and players are therefore encouraged to get together before the game \nbegins and go over any guidelines they feel may be necessary to avoid potential \nincidents and keep things running smoothly. Many such alterations are surprisingly \neasy to implement, especially considering the amount of trouble they prevent in the \nlong term. For example, games held in public venues might well consider using the \n“Bunny-Hop Rule.” This simple rule requires that players substitute potentially \nmenacing nouns like “gun” or “knife” with the word “bunny” and equally problematic \nverbs such as “shoot” or “stab” with the word “hop.” This may sound silly at first, but \nif you’re playing in a nightclub or college lounge with a lot of ordinary people within \nearshot, which would you rather hear an overly excited player accidentally shout: \n“He’s got a gun! Shoot him!” Or “He’s got a bunny! Hop him!”? The former outburst \ncould easily spark a minor riot and possibly a call to the authorities as well, while the \nlatter remark is much less likely to result in a bad scene, especially if your players are \notherwise abiding by the rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre and not doing anything \nimmature such as carrying weapon props. \nIn short, while you should feel free to enjoy this book, this game and the character \nyou play, you should also remember that no game is played in a vacuum. Unless you’re \nplaying in aprivate space where your game is guaranteed to have absolutely no contact \nwith “mundanes” (and possibly sometimes even then), bear in mind that you have a \nresponsibility to your game and your group to make sure that your actions don’t unduly \nalarm or intimidate non-players. Remember those core guidelines for all Minds Eye \nTheatre chronicles, The Only Rules That Matter, and take extra care to Be Mindful \nof Others. Play hard, but play responsibly - \ndon’t do or say things that might get you \nor your game bounced from your location, much less anything that could likely result \nin someone summoning the authorities. Not only is doing so utterly bad form if not \noutright criminal), but it’s disruptive to the game in general and a grave dissemice to \nyour Storyteller and fellow players as well. Don’t do it. \nFor the 99.9% of you who don’t need this disclaimer to game safely and \nresponsibly, read on and have fun. \nINRODUCTORY \nDISCLAIMER \n11 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The anarchs’ history is one of the most \ntragic and most passionate stories in the annals of Caine’s descendants. Despite \ncountless defeats and setbacks, not to mention active predation by the two most \ndeadly sects to stalk the night, true anarchs have always returned to champion their \nbeliefs, even to a society that largely reviles them for doing so. \nEven first-generation converts - \nthose who leave another sect to joiin the \nMovement -do so out of a sense that the anarchs, for all their flaws, are fundamentally \ncorrect about the injustice of Kindred society. Many Kindred who dislike certain \naspects of Camarilla society still remain within its bounds because it is familiar and, to \na certain degree, safe. Likewise, while the debauched excesses and brutal conflicts of the \nSabbat horrify even some of its most jaded members, the majority remain if for no other \nreason than because they cannot envision surviving the night without a strong group \nto belong to.

      "text": "So as the history book opens and the tragic and triumphant tale of the Anarch \nRevolt unfolds, the question becomes not why to play an anarch, but indeed, why not \nto play one. \nTHE CLIMATE \nOFTHF RFVOLT \nThe 14th century was one of the worst periods in recent history to be a Cainite \nin Europe. Between the growing power of the Inquisition, invading armies in the east, \nand the advent of mortal diseases (such as the Black Death) that could send vampires \ninto torpor, many Cainites wanted nothing more than to disappear from the world \nentirely and be left alone. In the midst of these threats, many elders decided to do \nexactly that, choosing solitude and self-preservation over their feudal obligations to \nprotect their childer. Refusing to accept and react to anunfavorable situation the way \nthe elders had, neonates of Europe took their cue from mortal revolts to create their \nown destiny, to seize the freedom and rights they desired from their oppressive sires. \nThus was conceived what would become the Anarch Movement. \nTheir response was well timed. By the beginning of the 13th century, the Church \nhad begun stepping up efforts to combat heresy, by appointing specialized judges who \nanswered only to the pope, chosen from the new Dominican and Franciscan priestly \norders. Within the Dominican order grew the Society of Leopold, whose members \nconcerned themselves with finding and destroying perceived supernatural threats to the \nChurch. The Society of Leopold refined its methods throughout the rest of the 13th \ncentury, and by 1300, it had succeeded in destroying hundreds of Cainites across Europe, \nparticularly in and around Spain, where the Inquisition had been founded. Most heavily \naffected were the Spanish Brujah, Lasombra and Ventrue, and more neonates than elders \n(although more than a few elders owed their ends to the Society of Leopold, as well). \nThe elders’ reaction to this new threat was to continue the time-honored \ntradition of using their childer as cannon fodder. Most elders went into hiding, \nleaving their progeny to deal with (or be destroyed by) the hunters on their own. \nSome even helped lead the zealous Dominicans to the havens of their childer, in the \nhopes that throwing some bait to the enemy might slow its pursuit. In the short term, \nthis strategy did help to divert attention from the elders’ own whereabouts, but it also \ncreated great animosity between the neonates of Spain and the elders who had taken \nadvantage of them. In addition, the neonates proved themselves far more resourceful \nin combating the hunters than their elders had expected, aiding each other when \nTHE ANARCH \nG~IDE \n14 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The eventual denial of these requests by princes and elders afraid of \nbecoming targets by association served to increase the neonates’ resentment. \nLike so many events in the history of the Kindred, the spark that ignited what was \nto become the Anarch Revolt came not from a Cainite, but from a mortal. In 138 1, the \npeasant Wat Tyler led a revolt of his fellow peasants against local British nobility. The \nrevolutionaries killed the Archbishop of Canterbury and held London for a short while, \nforcing the king to fulfill some of their demands. The king’s agents captured Tyler’s \nlover, Patricia of Bolingbroke, and she was promptly sentenced to death. While she was \nin prison, she met Robin Leeland, a Brujah of some repute, who Embraced her and \naccepted her pledge to fight for justice for all eternity. Taking the last name Tyler after \nher now fallen lover, Patricia escaped and gathered like-minded individuals (mortal \nand Cainite alike) to attack the English nobility in his name. Once she finally realized \nthe futility of this pursuit, Tyler left England for Spain, where she came into contact \nwith a Ventrue elder called Hardestadt, the originator of the idea of the Camarilla. \nAs she learned of Hardestadt’s plans, Patricia found herself hard pressed to see \na difference between an organization of elders banding together for mutual protec- \ntion and the nobles who had destroyed her family and everyone she once loved. She \nexpressed her distaste for the idea quite forcefully- by leading a large coterie of like- \nminded Brujah and Lasombra neonates in an assault on Hardestadt’s castle. Although \nthe group suffered numerous casualties, Tyler herself was able to reach the incredu- \nlous Hardestadt, destroy him and devour his soul. \nWhen word of her victory reached other Spanish Brujah neonates, they erupted \nin a frenzy against the elders who had betrayed them and refused to come to their aid \nin times past. No declaration of war was necessary and no banners were flown. Young \nSpanish Brujah decided as a group that they’d had enough of being manipulated and \nundervalued by the elders who, under the Lextalionis they claimed to value so much, \nshould be responsible for helping to protect them. In some ways, this uprising \nresembled a mass frenzy among the younger generations of the Brujah; with little or \nno warning, they tumed violently upon their elders, thirsty not for potent vitae, but \nfor the freedom and equality they had so long been denied. The revolutionaries began \nusing the term anarch to describe themselves, as a symbol of their contempt for \ntraditional elder dominance over childer. After overcoming the initial shock, the \nelders naturally fought back, and the blood of old and young Cainites alike ran freely \nthrough the streets of Spain. \nMuch of this blood belonged to the ancillae, who were generally weaker and \nmore accessible than the elders sought by the anarchs. A few ancillae did join the \nAnarch Revolt, most often in the hope of gaining greater power, but the majority \nremained in the service of their sires. Those who did became the first lines of defense \nagainst the onslaught of anarchs, which - \nafter the loss of their neonate servants to \nthe anarch cause - \nsuited the elders perfectly. \nEspecially considering its final outcome, the Anarch Revolt is sometimes \noverlooked by modem students of Cainite history as a failed attempt to establish a \nnew social order. The Revolt was itself a great breakthrough, however, in the social \nCHAFER ONE: HIVORY IN ASHES \n15 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Far more than a small band of diablerists, \nthe anarchs were a group of Cainites devoted to changing Kindred society for the \nbetter. Although the initial attacks might have been motivated by pure revenge, the \nanarchs were drawn ever closer by their commitment to creating a Cainite power \nstructure in which they could be secure. If the elders would only respond to deadly \nforce, though, the anarchs were prepared to deliver it. \nSome modem conspiracy theorists point to the simultaneous frenzy of several \ngenerations of Brujah as an indication that the Anarch Revolt was simply a move in \nthe plans of some elder hoping to eliminate rivals. If this were true, it could very well \nbe one of the greatest ruses in Kindred history - \nto trick the neonates of an entire clan \ninto attacking their elders, and even further, to believe it was their own idea and not \none planted in their minds. With few exceptions, however, the few who subscribe to \nthis theory count themselves among the Clan of the Moon, as only an “enlightened” \nmind can grasp the subtleties of such a vast and effective move in the Jyhad. Most \nKindred agree, however, that the Brujah were reacting instinctively to the centuries of \nneglect they had suffered at the hands of their sires. Even if the designs of a Methuselah \nwere somehow involved, without the rage and indignation of the Brujah who would \nbecome anarchs, such a plan could not have had even a chance of success. \nDespite their enthusiasm, rage, and craftiness, however, the anarchs soon found \nthemselves at a distinct disadvantage. Once the element of surprise had been \nexhausted, the anarchsfaced an enemy that was, on the whole, far more experienced, \npowerful and resourceful than they. After the preparations most elders had taken to \nguard against the Society of Leopold, those few whose havens were even accessible \nhad dizzying arrays of servants, ghouls, childer, traps and other deterrents to potential \nenemies - \nnot to mention the powers at the disposal of the elders themselves. \nThe anarchs also quickly learned to their dismay that enthusiasm and spirit are \nno substitute for a central organization and a communications network; too often, \nthey allowed old rivalries to resurface among themselves rather than devoting \nthemselves fully to their stated cause. At this point, only a few Cainites of other clans \njoined the Brujah in their revolt, as most considered it a problem of the Brujah clan \nalone, rather than as the general social uprising it was. As a result, the revolt did not \nextend much beyond the borders of Spain for most of the 14th century. As the \nconflict dragged on, anarchs found themselves fighting against servants several steps \nremoved from the elders they sought, which was just the type of conflict that the \nelders knew they could eventually win. \nDespite the slowing success of the anarchs, news of their effort spread quickly \nthrough the Kindred courts of Europe. In their havens and salons, Cainites of all clans \nbegan to discuss an idea that might have been considered a breach of the Traditions \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n16 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Naturally, younger Cainites were most receptive to the idea. \nSome felt that all Cainites should unite to combat the common threat of the \nInquisition, while others saw the Inquisition as an opportunity to demand greater \nfreedom in exchange for aiding the elders. Notions of greater freedom varied from \nCainite to Cainite, from freedom to Embrace or to choose one’s own victims to \ncomplete independence from elder control, but many of the anarchs’ ideas found \nreceptive audiences in neonates outside of Spain. \nThe response among elders was much the opposite.

Around the year 1400, Gratiano began secretly aiding the \nAnarch Movement, offering his advice on organizing the sometimes fractious anarchs \ninto a more streamlined fighting force, and helping to identify the Movement’s major \nleaders. In addition, he spread the anarchs’ message to the Lasombra neonates of Italy. \nMost importantly, however, Gratiano took it upon himself to travel to the Holy Land, \nwhere he made contact with the Assamites on the anarchs’ behalf. \nCHAIER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHES \n17 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

For the most part, though, they \nhad failed to locate many elders in Spain, since the battles between elder and anarch \nhad driven most of the elders into hiding. The Assamites needed help finding elders, \nwhich the Brujah could provide, and the Brujah needed the Assamites’ help as scouts, \nadvisors and sorcerers. The Assamites’ talents for stealth helped the Bruj ah to find \nand enter previously impenetrable elder havens, and in return, the Assamites \nreceived the Amaranth they desired. The tide of the revolt slowly began to turn \nagainst the Spanish elders. \nAt the same time, Gratiano’s efforts at spreading the anarch message to neonates \nin Italy came to fruition. In 1446, Lasombra neonates and ancillae gathered in \nVerona, where they resolved to start their own revolt in Italy. Although he did not \nattend the meeting, Gratiano’s campaign of confusion and misinformation among \nItalian elders helped to ensure that they were even less prepared for initial anarch \nattacks than the elders of Spain had been. For the next 35 years, the anarchs’ attacks \nraged virtually unchecked throughout Italy. \nIn about 1483, Gratiano led many Brujah, Lasombra and Assamite anarchs in \nan attack on the Lasombra Antediluvian’s haven in Sicily. Both the anarchs and the \nAncient’s servants suffered heavy losses, but eventually the five surviving anarchs, \nGratiano among them, succeeded in reaching the haven’s inner sanctum. Once \nthere, they drained the creature dry - \nand, at least by some accounts, diablerized it \nas well. When news of the anarchs’ victory spread to other Lasombraelders, many lost \ntheir will to fight; those who did not disappear eventually joined the anarch cause out \nof simple necessity. Rather than assuming leadership of the clan, Gratiano declared \nthat the Lasombra would now choose their leaders based on merit rather than age or \ngeneration. Unfortunately, most Lasombra anarchs became so involved in arguing \nand fighting over what this new merit system would be that their involvement with \nthe Anarch Movement all but ceased. Not until the creation of the Sabbat would \nthese Lasombra again leave their mark on Kindred society. \nTHE BOND \nBREAKERS \nThe Tzimisce of Eastern Europe may not have had to worry about the Inquisition, \nbut beset as they were by multiple invading forces, this was small consolation at best. \nBetween the Germans on the west, the Mongols on the east, the Turks on the south \nand the Teutonic Knights on the north, it seemed at this point that the entire mortal \nworld wanted a piece of the clan’s ancestral lands. Even worse, the Tzimisce also found \nthemselves at war with the Tremere, determined to stamp out koldunic sorcery to \npreserve their perceived monopoly on blood magic. Like the Spanish Brujah before \nthem, the Tzimisce took the easy way out - \nsacrificing their childer while slinking off \nto hide in well-guarded castles and fortresses to plan their next move. \nBut thanks to the Tzimisce neonates Velya and Lugoj (later known as Blood- \nbreaker), this situation soon swung in the neonates’ favor. The two discovered the \nkoldunic ritual that could break the blood bonds holding so many neonates in thrall - \nthe same ritual that would later become the Vaulderie after the formation of the Sabbat. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n18 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The secret of the Vaulderie spread quickly among the \nyounger Fiends, many ofwhom soon discovered that without the false loyalty of the blood \nbond, they hated their sires passionately. Inspired by the example of the Spanish Erujah, \nthey decided to rise up, overthrow their sires and end this oppression permanently. \nAlthough a few Tzimisce neonates remained with their masters out of genuine \nloyalty, the vast majority joined Lugoj Bloodebreaker in his call for the elders’ blood. \nThe offensive began in 1459, and with their personal knowledge of many of the \nelders’ havens, the Tzimisce anarchs often found themselves successful where even \nthe Tremere had failed. Beyond their devotion to mutual security and freedotn, the \nyoung Fiends found themselves growing ever closer through the Vaulderie as well. As \na result, their organization far surpassed that of the elder Fiends, who were still too \nproud to trust each other. Like the Lasombra of Italy, the young Tzimisce used a \nconvert-or-die approach toward their elders, with a surprising degree of success. \nThe final blow to the elders’ morale came when Lugoj and his coterie, also \nfollowing the Lasombra’s example, invaded the haven of the Tzimisce Antediluvian. \nLugoj claimed the right to diablerize the Ancient himself, taking its power for his \nown, and in recognition of the freedom he had helped so many anarchs to reach, the \nothers allowed him to do so. Lugoj then sank into torpor, as did the resolve of the \nremaining independent elders of clan Tzimisce. The anarchs soon found that the \nencroaching forces were too much for even them to handle, and most decided to head \nwest into Central and Western Europe. \nTHF RFVOLT \nUpon reaching Eastern Europe, the Tzimisce anarchs proved to be the deciding \nfactor in spreading the anarch revolt beyond the boundaries of Spain and Italy. The \nrevolt in Spain had been underway for over acentury, and in Italy nearly as long:, with \nboth areas suffering heavy casualties. The arrival of the Fiends with the secret of the \nVaulderie upset what fragile balance remained between neonates and elders in other \nEuropean countries. Anxious to be free of their blood bonds, neonates and arcillae \nof every clan flocked to the anarch cause, eagerly trading a pledge of loyalty to the \nAnarch Movement for freedom from their elders’ control. \nIn the confusion that ensued, clan boundaries between the anarchs were often \nforgotten in the battle to destroy local elders. A few elders successfully negotiated \npeace terms with isolated anarch groups, but many of these soon found that other \nanarchs did not know about or respect such agreements. The lines between anarch \nand loyal childe also became blurred, often because of elders’ fear of destruction - \nsome childer found themselves thrown out of the haven of a sire to whom they were \ncompletely loyal, simply because of their generation. Such displaced Cainites often \nadded to the ranks of the anarch cause, for protection if not out of genuine agreement. \nTHE CHURCHSTRIKFC~RACK \nIf the elders who had survived this long through the Anarch Revolt had learned \none thing from the conflict, it was never to underestimate their childer.

As the Revolt \nintensified, both sides became increasingly sloppy about hiding the conflict from the \nmortals around them. This was particularly true for clans Toreador and Lasombra, \nwhose power bases were concentrated partly in the Church, and as a result were \nalready closer to the Inquisition’s view than most clans. \nAs evidence of supernatural threats to the Church increased, several members \nof the Society of Leopold petitioned Pope Innocent VI11 for greater support. The \nPope responded in 1484 by making witches the official concern of the Inquisition. \nHe also increased the resources at the Inquisition’s disposal and appointed the first \nInquisitor-General to oversee the organization’s new goal. The renewed Society of \nLeopold successfully destroyed scores of vampires across Europe. Although the \nInquisition was unaware of distinctions between elder and anarch, more anarchs \nsuffered from its notice because the elders were generally much more experienced at \nhiding themselves. This became increasingly true as Toreador and Ventrue elders \nestablished contacts within the Inquisition and enjoyed some success at directing it. \nTHF FOUNDING \nOF THF CAMARILLA \nTHF FLDFRS \nUNITE \nThroughout the Revolt, a group of Cainites led by a Ventrue calling himself \nHardestadt (strange in itself, since the original Hardestadt had been slain by Tyler nearly \na century before) continued to advocate the formation of a large organization of \n“Kindred” who would work together to crush the anarchs. After the Lasombra neonates \nrevolted in 1446, many elders agreed to limited cooperation, sharing resources, informa- \ntion and childer for attacks against anarchs and Assamites. However, in 1486 Hardestadt \nconvinced the leaders of the major European clans to take their cooperation one step \nfurther by sending representatives to a formal meeting inVienna. This was the beginning \nof the Camarilla, and the beginning of the end for the Anarch Revolt. \nThe formation of the Camarilla removed the one advantage the anarchs had left \n-despite their relative disorganization, their conviction had thus far helped to unite \nthem and make them more effective than the elders. With elders beginning to work \nclosely together, though, the anarchs found themselves up against an enemy not only \nolder, wiser, and more experienced, but also far better organized. Between the agents \nof the Inquisition and those of the new Camarilla, the anarchs were outnumbered, \noutmaneuvered, and outclassed. By 1493, only seven years after the formation of the \nCamarilla, numerous anarch leaders met with Hardestadt to discuss terms of peace. \nWhile some anarchs considered this a betrayal of the cause, these leaders felt it was \nbetter tonegotiate while they still had some power, rather than being forced to accept \nfar less favorable terms after a decisive defeat somewhere down the line. \nLeaders from both sides met in the Abbey of the Sacred Crown near the small \nEnglish village of Thorns, where they drafted what came to be known as the \nConvention of Thorns.

As a whole, the Convention was less like a peace agreement \nthan a set of terms for surrender, but most of the anarchs accepted it, particularly the \nBrujah, who had suffered the greatest losses. \nThe Assamites, who had also suffered heavily during the revolt, declined the offer \nto j oin the Camarilla.

      "text": "REVOLUTION’S ASHES \nUpon first glance after the conclusion of the Convention of Thorns, the Anarch \nRevolt had been a dismal failure. Many anarchs considered the devastation of the \nlands they had loved, the destruction of their comrades and the lesson of the futility \nof rebellion to be the only things gained from their struggle. Not one word of the \nLextalionis had been altered, and young Kindred had no more say in clan or sect \naffairs than before. Many questioned whether the centuries of struggle and all the \nFinal Deaths of their comrades had been in vain. \nWhat these unhappy souls failed to realize was that although they had failed in \ntheir stated goal of reforming Kindred society, they had nonetheless succeeded at \ntransforming themselves and those around them. The anarchs’ show of strength, \nwhile ultimately unsuccessful, had opened the eyes of Cainite elders to the true \npotency of their childer and taught these elders something to which many of them \nwere unaccustomed: fear. Before the revolt, few elders questioned that their domi- \nnance over their childer was the natural way of Cainites. Now, some began to \nquestion the “better to be feared than loved” approach. Some elders grew more \ndevious as a result, learning to subtly maneuver their childer toward affection for \nthem rather than controlling them with an iron hand. Regardless, all elders were now \npainfully aware that should they cross the line between forcefulness and cruelty, their \nchilder were fully capable of seeing that they paid for it in blood. \nFor their part, the anarchs had learned several valuable lessons as well. The first \nwas that any elder - \nindeed, even an Antediluvian - \nwas no match for a large \nenough and strong enough group of vampires willing to sacrifice anything and \neverything to achieve its goal. For agroup of Kindred who had been taught - \nin some \ncases, had been practically brainwashed into believing - \nthat their elders were \nbeings of nearly godlike power and influence, this was a substantial revelation, and \nit meant that eternal servitude was no longer inevitable, whatever the Convention \nof Thorns might say. Hand in hand with this realization was the new knowledge that \nthe myth of the relationship between elder and neonate was nothing more than that. \nWhether the Lextalionis was truly handed down from Caine or created by some elder \nin the past, its reach extended only to those who chose to subscribe to it. \nAlmost two centuries before Enlightenment philosophes such as Locke and \nRousseau proposed similar ideas, anarch philosophers had developed the concept of \nlibertas - \nthe free will with which all Kindred are endowed, regardless of age or \ngeneration. Kindred historians point to this as one of the few episodes in history \nwhere the Kindred anticipated mortal trends rather than following them. Anarchs \ntaught their childer that libertas was important above all things, and most impor- \ntantly, that attempts to deprive a Kindred of libertas should be treated just as seriously \nas attempts to deprive him ofpossessions or ofunlife itself. Even (and especially) after \nthey had forcibly rejoined the Camarilla, anarchs passed on the legacy of libertas and \nthe vision of a society of equal Kindred to their childer and grandchilder, in the hope \nthat it might still come to exist someday. \nThe final and most tangible effect of the Anarch Revolt is one that most anarchs \nwho know of it desperately wish they could forget - \nthe creation of the two great \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n24 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

In the global scheme of things, the fact that the \nanarchs forced formerly xenophobic elders to cooperate with each other might be \nseen as a significant evolutionary step, but naturally, most anarchs are hard-pressed \nto see it that way. As if that weren’t bad enough, the few anarchs with the backbone \nto stand up for their convictions at the Convention of Thorns perverted those \nconvictions to create the Sabbat, whose rigid structure and group blood bonding \npractices also run counter to everything true anarchs stood for. Enforced, artificial \nloyalty to a group rather than to an individual doesn’t make that loyalty any less \nartificial or mandatory. \nAccording to some modem Kindred students of history, later revolts of the \nanarchs against their elders might have been avoided if the elders had simply been \nwilling to share a small amount of power with their childer. If the Camarilla had been \nless concerned with saving face and more concerned with creating a truly maintain- \nable peace, the terms of the Convention might have given the anarchs enough \nfreedom and power that the Sabbat would not exist today. Instead, by returning the \nanarchs to the same situation against which they had originally rebelled, the elders \nensured that the same resentment and discontent that fueled the Anarch .Revolt \nwould remain to erupt later in unexpected ways. \nTIMF \nMARCHFS \nONWARD \nTHE FRENCH \nREVOLUTION \nFor nearly three centuries, the Camarilla’s claim of domain in Europe lay \nunchallenged. Many anarchs traveled to the American colonies to escape their elders’ \ninfluence, and by and large the elders were glad to be rid of them. Most elders considered \nthe colonies beneath their notice, and the anarchs traveling there doubly so, and were \nglad to once again claim dominion over Europe. Even if their confidence in their own \ninfallibility had been badly shaken, at least they didn’t have to worry about slavering \nanarch bands breaking down their doors and murdering them in their havens. \nAt least, not until 1789. However unconcerned the elders may have been about \nthe colonies, the anarchs of Europe had been greatly affected by the American \nRevolution. In the political statements of the mortal political philosophers I’aine, \nAdams, Jefferson, and Franklin-as well as Locke, Rousseau, and the others who had \ninspired them - \nthe anarchs found a great deal that resonated with their own \npolitical vision. When the mortals of France, stirred by events across the Atlantic, \nbegan to grumble about their treatment at the hands of King Louis XVI and his \nnobles, a number ofprominent anarchs secretly urged them on. Among the peasants \nwho stormed the Bastille in July 1789 were a number of Kindred expressing their \ndistaste for the traditional Toreador dominion of France and who saw the grc’wing \nrevolution as their chance to strike back. They knew they had little chance of success \nalone, but with the mortals whose cause they shared, they were able to xrike \ndecisively against the Toreador power base in France. Unlike the elders’ often cruel \nand self-serving use of mortals to further their own ends, the anarchs joined wit11 the \nFrench revolutionaries out of a real sense of kinship and identification with their \nCHAPERONE: \nHISTORY \nIN ASHE \n25 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Whatever their faults, the anarchs saw the French peasants as people, rather \nthan simply as pawns or food. \nEcstatic at the success of the revolution, the anarchs quickly began making plans \nto spread it to other countries. Their mortal allies proved less than faithful, however. \nThe National Convention, which had been founded to rule France after the \nexecution of Louis, dissolved into wrangling committees, which gave the Toreador \nand Ventrue elders a chance to shift the balance of power once again. They plotted \nthe overthrow of the convention through their own agents and allies, installing a \nFrench general named Bonaparte as the head of the government in 1799. Eventually \nnaming himself Emperor of France, Bonaparte quickly extinguished the egalitarian \nreforms of the revolution, and the Toreador regained their place as the dominant \nKindred in France soon thereafter. Despite this defeat, however, the revolution once \nagain showed the Camarilla that even after long periods of apparent dormancy, the \nanarchs would always stand ready to fight for the cause of freedom. Still, more than \n150 years would pass before a similar outbreak occurred again. \nTHF VICTORIAN \nAGE \nThe late 18‘h and early 19‘h centuries saw the growth of a literary movement \nknown as Romanticism, which emphasized mystery, the supernatural, and strong \nemotions such as love, hatred and horror over the strict rationalist teachings of the \nprevious century. Along with this came a new idealism, expressed in the develop- \nment of several types of socialism - \nboth the revolutionary form, exemplified by the \nwritings of Karl Marx, and the less radical utopian branch, which advocated the \ncreation of small, self-sufficient socialist communities. In the year 1848, a number of \nrevolutions broke out across Europe; although most of these uprisings eventually \nended in failure, some revolts continued, eventually leading to the creation ofunified \nGerman and Italian states. Although some anarchs were no doubt involved with \nboth, the true ray of hope for the anarchs in this century came at its end with the \nblossoming of the Victorian Age. \nIt was also a time in which civility and decorum reigned supreme; a gentleman’s \nname was everything to him, and some princes who wished to seem benevolent even \nappointed anarch liaisons “for the good of all Kindred.” Anarchs found themselves able \nto discuss their beliefs in the salons and balls of polite Kindred society, so long as they \nbehaved themselves, and some Kindred came to see the light of reform. Elected princes, \nonce unheard-of, became an occasional occurrence thanks to the prevalence of anarch \nideas, and some princes (elected and otherwise) even relaxed the Traditions. Some \nallowed all members of the domain to Embrace once a year without obtaining explicit \npermission, while others instituted personal Domains for all prominent Kindred or \nrelaxed the Tradition of Hospitality to apply only to Elysium. \nIndeed, it seemed for a short while that the dream of the anarchs might become \na reality, and members active during the era still speak of it as a time of promise, when \nanything might have come to pass. But however great the strides made then might \nhave seemed, the Camarilla was still run by Kindred, with a Beast lurking deep in \ntheir hearts.

Anarch resentment at this new \nfailure grew, and many decided (like those before them) to try creating their utopian \nstate in the New World. It would take over half a century to begin the groundwork \nfor another period of upheaval. \nA DRFAM \nDFFFRRFD \nTHE ANARCH \nFREE \n5TATF \nWith the restoration of Toreador dominance in France, many anarchs left for \nAmerica, which was still relatively free of Camarilla influence at this point; following \nthe end of the Victorianera, more anarchs did the same. Many of the Camarilla elders \nconsidered America a trackless wasteland, and in keeping with old tradition some \neven considered it a useful “dumping ground” for disgruntled Cainites. The Sabbat \nhad a presence in America, but internal dissension had interfered with its efforts to \ngain a foothold in the New World. \nDespite this power vacuum, however, the anarchs failed to create any large-scale \ndomains for themselves in the Americas. Some Camarilla Kindred have used this to \njustify their opinion that the anarchs are ineffectual without the Camarilla to react \nto. In response, anarch scholars are quick to point out that most of the anarchj who \narrived in America were on the run from the princes and archons of the Camarilla, \nhad no idea whom they could trust, and certainly had no central organization to \nconsult for help. On the whole, they were only interested in finding a quiet hunting \nground and lying low. \nOf course, the Camarilla eventually came to America, and in typical fashion, it \nquickly and systematically claimed domains across the East Coast. The confrontations \nthat resulted between the resident anarchs of a city and the better-organized Camarilla \nmembers rarely came to violence. Rather, as a city became more important and better \npopulated, the anarchs dwelling there would suddenly find their former hunting \ngrounds occupied by a prince and his court. The usurpers would politely point out that \nthis was now a Camarilla city and perhaps the anarch would find better hunting to the \nwest. Though slow, this process of displacement was constant and unavoidable. By \n1900, a number of anarchs found themselves on the West Coast, particularly in San \nFrancisco and the small town that would become known as Los Angeles. \nIn 1900, Los Angeles was already beginning to experience the almost miraculous \ngrowth that would turn it from a tiny town of about 10,000 into one of the largest cities \nin the world within less than a century. The Camarilla recognized that it needed to \ncreate a presence in this potentially important city, and in 1924, its council rn,ad.de a \nformer Spanish alcalde named Don Sebastian Juan Dominguez prince of the City of \nAngels on the condition that he would “do something about the anarch problem.” \nUnfortunately for those who chose him, they had badly misjudged the new \nprince of Los Angeles. Don Sebastian was a vain, indolent creature whose idea of \nsociety was to surround himself with effete Toreadors like himself and let everyone \nelse do mainly as they pleased.

Anarchs from around the country made the exodus to Los Angeles and \nthe other small cities that surrounded it. \nOne of the anarchs who moved into the Los Angeles area was a Brujah named \nJeremy MacNeil. MacNeil had been Embraced in 1657, long after the Anarch Revolt, \nbut his sire, James, was part of Tyler’s initial peasant revolt in 1381, and fought on the \nanarch side in Spain and Italy. He taught Jeremy to love freedom and fight oppression, \nand Jeremy had struggled against the British overlords in Scotland, Ireland and \nAmerica. The princes of every city in the United States soon came to know and revile \nhis name, and so he eventually ended up drifting into Los Angeles in 1943. \nOnce there, MacNeil found a powder keg ready to explode. More and more anarchs \nwere moving into the area, which now boasted such anarch luminaries as Salvador \nGarcia, Marguerite Foccart and the notorious Smiling Jack. The rest of the Los Angeles \nKindred were increasingly disgusted by Don Sebastian’s capricious princedom, which had \na habit of swaying unpredictably from complete hisser faire to utter repression. The \nanarchs found this situation all too familiar. Very few of them had witnessed the Anarch \nRevolt, but most knew that the anarchs of old had rebelled against their elders and almost \nmanaged to create a society where a Kindred would be valued not for his generation or \nclan but for his individual worth. They also knew that the past anarch leaders had \nbetrayed the dream and that the Camarilla Kindred ultimately kept power for themselves. \nHere in California, the young anarchs reasoned, they finally had the opportunity to create \nthe utopia about which the first anarchs had dreamed. By living together in harmony \nwithout a prince or primogen, they would show anarchs everywhere that the time had \ncome for agloriousrevolutionagainst allwhowouldrob themoftheir liberty andfreewill. \nBy 1944, the rumblings ofdiscontent among the local Kindred had reached even \nDon Sebastian’s ears, and he knew just how to deal with the problem. He ordered \nJeremy MacNeil detained and savagely beaten, figuring that this act would kill any \ndesire to rise up on the part of these foolish revolutionaries. Salvador and many of the \nother anarchs wanted to use the incident as the rallying point for a new revolt, but \nMacNeil counseled patience and preparation. So the anarchs studied the prince and \nprimogen for six weeks, locating their havens and learning about their defenses. \nFinally, on December 21, 1944, the Second Anarch Revolt began. Just before \ndawn, parties of heavily armed anarchs attacked many of the city’s elders in their \nhavens. While not all of the attacks resulted in victories, an appreciable majority did, \nand those Kindred who managed to escape mostly fled the city as quickly as possible. \nDon Sebastian himself was slain by Salvador Garcia in a vicious combat that ended \nwith Don Sebastian’s rancho burning to the ground. \nAfter their initial successes in Los Angeles, the anarchs moved south and \n‘‘liberated)) San Diego, then moved north in the hopes of doing the same in San \nFrancisco. There, however, they were unsuccessful, as then-prince Vannevar Tho- \nmas mounted a strong defense and turned them away. Nonetheless, the anarchs had \nachieved quite a bit in three months.

The Revolutionary Council, which had been formed to coordinate the \nmilitary efforts of the anarchs, decided to adopt a set of principles of self-governance \nfor the Free State before dissolving itself. It created what it called the “!Status \nPerfectus,” or the “Perfect State.” \nAlthough clearly based on earlier anarch philosophies, the Status Perfectus was \na revolutionary document, the first to state the anarch dream clearly and unequivo- \ncally in modern times. It called on anarchs everywhere to care for one another \nregardless of clan affiliation and to help each other break free from the shackles of the \nLextalionis. It promised a nation free of political oppression and elder prejudice and \nswore to extend that freedom to all Kindred everywhere. \nThe immediate aftermath of the Second Anarch Revolt surprised all of the \nKindred, especially the anarchs. Rather than joining together in a glorious fellow- \nship, the Kindred of the Free State almost immediately formed themselves into \ncross-clan coteries and gangs that staked out a geographical area (which they referred \nto as a barony) and forbade anyone else to hunt there. It was almost as if, in the \nabsence of a Camarilla to create and uphold princes and domains, the anarchs had \nto re-create the same structure themselves. \nThis was a terrible philosophical blow to the anarch scholars who came to study \nthe Anarch Free State in the hopes that it would be the modem re-creation of their \nbeloved ideal. What they found instead were packs of Kindred who were frequendy - \nand often literally- at each other’s throats. Scholars argued over whether this inability \nto create a grander society was a result of the Beast that lies snarling within the breast \nofevery Kindred, or whether it was merely a transitional stage through which the Status \nPerfectus had to go on its way toward a more unified egalitarian society. \nUnfortunately, the anarchs never had the chance to find out. The Free State was \nremarkably resilient, surviving a direct attack by the Sabbat in 1965 and an enormous \ncivil war between a Kindred and a mortal gang in 1992, but ultimately proved too \nprecarious to hold during a Cathayan invasion in 1998. What eventually brouglnt an \nend to the Anarch Free State was a combination of external plotting and intmemal \ndissension. The Quincunx of the Cathayans, forced to conclude that it was not \neconomically feasible to take the Free State by force, began a divide-and-conquer \nstrategy. The invaders offered Salvador Garcia, who led the Hermandad gang, \nassistance in his ongoing battle with the Crypt’s Sons, run by Mohammed al-Muthlim. \nAlthough no one fully understands why a canny old guerrilla fighter like Salvador \nwould accept help from a group that had only recently attacked his beloved Anarch \nFree State, he did, and that was the beginning of the end for the anarch realm. \nWithin a few months, high-profile anarchs from across the domain were \naccepting positions with the Cathayan forces. The Quincunx cleverly sold them- \nselves to the weary anarchs as peace-bringers and preservers of the egalitarian dream. \nUnder the “New Promise Mandarinate,” those who were qualified would rise to \npositions of power, and the strongest would no longer prosper at the expense of the \nweak. To the anarchs, weakened from decades of internal warfare, the prospect was \nultimately too appealing to resist. By the beginning of 2000, virtually all of Los \nAngeles was the domain of the New Promise Mandarinate. \n+- \nI \nCHAPTER ONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHIS \n29 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

In fact, the strength of the anarchs has \noften been their relative lackoforganization; no matter how many anarchs aredefeated \nor killed, more always appear from some dark corner or concealed hideout. In the wake \nof the end of the Anarch Free State, anarchs have fanned out across the United States, \nsome even returning to Europe to spread their message. In some ways, the new Anarch \nMovement is even more dangerous than the Free State, since discontented Kindred \nhave nowhere to go now when they’ve had enough of unlife under the Camarilla. They \nmust either submit or fight on, and the anarchs know that a number of these desperately \nunhappy Kindred will choose the latter. \nDespite these new rumblings of discontent, which are now appearing through- \nout most Camarilla (and some Sabbat) cities, most elders have stopped worrying \nabout the anarchs. This indifference is symptomatic of the same flawed and largely \nwishful thinking that has plagued the elders since 1381, and likely since time \nimmemorial - \nregarding a threat as entirely gone when it disappears temporarily. \nThe anarchs are more than a simple group of like-minded Kindred with a common \ngoal; they share a dedication to freedom and the idea of libertas that will be difficult, \nif not impossible, ever to eliminate completely. \nDespite the ultimate failure of the Anarch Free State as a model for the anarchs’ \nideal society, Kindred historians and social scientists still often use the Movement \nitself as a basis for various theories. Many point to its continued existence as proof \nof the power of conviction and belief to unite people, even the undead, through the \nyears. Often, it also serves as an example of how such conviction can help maintain \nand strengthen the humnitas of those who pursue it, as strivingfor a very human goal \nlike freedom helps other human virtues to fall in line as well. For all the hardships \nthey have suffered through the long centuries, the anarchs remain the most humane \nsingle group of Kindred in the modem world, and their ideals continue to shake the \nhalls of the Camarilla and give pause to the packs of the Sabbat. Though battered and \nat times nearly broken, the anarchs still carry on; for each one that falls, another sees \nthe light of freedom and takes up the cause, and from their lips comes the cry: \nThere shall be no rest without freedom! \nTHL ANARCH &DE \n30 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

As per Laws of the Night, you can take \nadditional levels of an Ability to show higher proficiency in that field. \nDISCIPLINES \nYou begin play with three or four Basic Disciplines (depending on your previous \nsect affiliation, if any). You cannot take Disciplines beyond the Basic level at this \ntime. If you are Caitiff, you can choose your Basic powers from any Discipline, but \nthe Storyteller can choose to limit you to the eight most common Disciplines - \nAnimalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Potence or Presence - \nunless your character’s history makes a great case for having a more specialized \nDiscipline like Protean or Chimerstry. \nAs a rule of thumb, during character creation and beyond Storytellers should be \nslightly more lenient when permitting players to purchase out-of-clan Disciplines for \ntheir anarch characters. This is not - \nrepeat not - \nan excuse for players to min-max \ntheir Disciplines into power combinations just for the sake of having “kewl powerz”, \nbut rather a representation of the fact that anarchs are generally much more wi lling \nto teach their own Disciplines to members outside of their own clans than are their \nsect counterparts. Indeed, anarchs often use Disciplines as equalizers to compensate \nfor their lack of mundane resources or standing in Kindred society, and few anarchs \ncare about revealing hoary old “ancient clan secrets” if teaching a friend a specialized \nDiscipline means the difference between victory and defeat. \nOf course, an anarch‘s parent clan may have a different opinion on the matter \n- \ntrying to convince an enraged Tzimisce or Ravnos elder that you thought it would \nbe cool to teach your fellow gang members the secrets of the clan’s unique Discipline \nseldom works out very well. Storytellers should feel free to ensure that players who \nbecome known for teaching normally restricted Disciplines to those outside their \nclans face the appropriate consequences of that behavior.

      "text": "BACKGROUNDS \nChoose five Backgrounds for your new character. The vampiric struggle an \nanarch experiences focuses on the connections and assets that Backgrounds repre- \nsent, but in many cases such assets are firmly in the control of the sects, necessitating \nsome conflict or manipulation to acquire (not to mention keep). As such, Back- \ngrounds require special consideration at character creation. \nCommon Ties \nAllies, Contacts and Retainers are the most common Backgrounds for anarchs, and \nthey generally need not compete with the Kindred of the Camarilla or the Cainites of \nthe Sabbat for them. These Backgrounds are most often earned through the vampire’s \nsocial prowess, hard work, street savvy or just plain charisma as opposed to things like \nvampiric lineage or social standing. Nevertheless, these are valuable tools in the \nAnarch Cause, and as long as one can provide for their specialized needs in return the \nanarch can count on invaluable and often unexpected sources of aid when battling \nenemies or staking out new territory. What’s more, since most mortals who fill the roles \nof allies and contacts are not aware of vampiric existence, sect is not an issue. In fact, \nan anarch may even have some of the same contacts and allies as a Camarilla vampire, \nthough such double-dealing carries commensurate risks should the anarch‘s connec- \ntion be exposed. However, a shared contact or rival can be a source of intelligence on \nthe enemy and that information can be used to challenge an opponent’s plans. An \nanarch who manages to successfully turn or “poach” a particularly valued agent of one \nof the sects can earn great respect in the eyes of his peers. \nUncommon Ties \nBackgrounds that represent vampiric assets are the greatest cause of conflict in \nKindred society. Herd, Generation, Influence and Resources are at the heart of the \nanarch struggle. Most young Kindred don’t have much access to these Backgrounds, \nor have only one or two levels at most, and it is a struggle to hold on to even these \nwhen the sects keep them so closely guarded. The elders keep a stranglehold on \nInfluence and like their coffers thickly lined with Resources, and don’t take kindly to \nbrash upstarts trying to take either one away from them. For their part, few anarchs \nhave the time and money required to keep a large herd under control, although many \nhave a couple of fellow outcasts and other hangers-on whom they can look to for \nready vitae. Even Generation can be a liability among those who battle the domina- \ntion of the young - \nmany younger anarchs find it hard to trust an elder, or even one \nof low generation more recently Embraced. Most of the vampires not under the \nelders’ thumbs are neonates and will mistrust anyone who shows the power and force \nof will of an elder, especially if the Kindred in question is new to the Cause. \nWith regard to Influence and Resources, many anarchs find their efforts to increase \ntheir assets beyond the most humble means viciously blocked by the sects, which in \nturn prompted many to join the anarchs to beginwith. Ifyour character has assets, make \nsure you explain how she got them, and more importantly how she holds onto them in \nthe face of adversity.

Even those who \ndefected from the Sabbat often did so at least in part because they were unwilling to \nabandon the last of their Humanity in the name of the sect’s goals. Those who bring \ntheir adherence to a Path of Enlightenment with them may find themselves ostracized \nor even outright condemned by their fellow anarchs unless their Path’s teachings \nnaturally complement the goals of the Movement (or at least don’t horrify the other \nanarchs too much). Indeed, given their relative youth, few anarchs follow or are even \naware of the many Paths of Enlightenment of the Sabbat, let alone the other Paths \nexclusive to clans not well represented among the anarch population. \nIndeed, though the Anarch Revolt may date back some 600 years, many \nvampires who uphold the ideals of the Cause are too young to have lost so much \nMorality. They are still feeling creatures close to the human world and the revolu- \ntionary ideals they gained from it, and many treasure that closeness as a sign of the \nrighteousness of their cause. An anarch who decides to go against this trend and \nfollow an alternative Path of Enlightenment should take time to divest himself of his \nremaining human instincts and feelings. This is best done through a personal subplot, \nin which the anarch examines his own dwindling interest in Humanity and explores \nthe alternative Paths available to him through involved, demanding roleplaying and \nsoul-searching. For example, a neonate Lasombra antirribu recruit might have \nfollowed the Path of Humanity, but along with other lessons her mentor tells her of \nthe virtues of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice. Over time, the Lasombra may \nsee the advantages her teacher has spoken of, and decide to study this alternate Path \nof Enlightenment. Slowly, the young Lasombra works to remove her rapidly dwin- \ndling Humanity, stripping away all of her mind and spirit that does not conform to \nher new code of ethics and allowing herself to become a monster. After spending \nmonths shedding the last vestiges of human nature, she is finally ready to learn to \nlisten only to her own conscience and start on the other Path. \nThis is not to say that as a rule anarchs retain more Morality than their sect \ncounterparts. Many older veterans of the struggle and those who have survived the \nwars and countless battles lose balance and devote more and more time and effort to \nthe Cause rather than to spiritual matters, their soul’s inner balance between their \nhuman origins and the Beast within becoming secondary to the mundane needs of \nthe struggle. In the process, they lose touch with their past and their beginnings. The \nexperienced vampire’s Morality withers as a result of this frustration at the status quo \nand the endless conflict against the injustices of his existence. Sadly, hardcore \nveteran anarchs often risk falling to the Beast because their rage and frustration \nerodes their Morality and leaves nothing to fill that spiritual void unless they find an \nalternate Path of Enlightenment that encourages new behavior or they allow \nthemselves to fall to Wassail. \nCreating A Revolutionary Soul \nWhen assigning your Virtue Traits, don’t forget that you’re trying to capture the \ndifferent facets of a person’s soul- in this case, a person who not only has undergone \na horrifying transformation into one of the undead, but thrown away all ties to the \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n44 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Did she learn intense Self-control from an abusiv’e sire \nwho tormented her with the prospect of feeding on her loved ones? Or did she witness \nthe horrors of vampire society early and vowed that her Conscience would never let \nher turn a blind eye to its excesses? \nConversely, if your anarch has a low score in one or two Virtues, explain why this \nis the case - \nwas his Courage shattered after a particularly devastating defeat ,a few \nyears back, his Self-control a mess because of his unstable mental state or her \nConscience the worse for wear after a particularly brutal series of battles? Accounting \nfor your character’s Virtue Traits in this fashion not only helps define your character \nfurther, but also generates interesting backstories and insight into this new persona. \nExplain it all, and don’t be shy about pouring on the details; such are the flourishes \nof which great characters are made. \nNFGATIVF \nTRAITS \nNegative Traits bring your anarch’s personality to life and make it a more \nrealistic and believable creation. They also make a character more three-dimen- \nsional as no one, especially a vampire, is perfect. Negative Traits help develop and \nround out a character. You may take up to five Negative Traits but no more than three \ncan be in any one Attribute category. Negative Traits must be roleplayed - \nyou can \nreally act oblivious or shy or sickly when playing your character. Storytellers should \nfeel free to make players “buy off any Negative Trait they routinely ignore, since that \ncharacter has so obviously worked to overcome his handicap. As a general rule, you \nare required to portray your Negative Traits at least once per evening - \nit need not \nbe a particularly melodramatic display, but it should be something noticeable, such \nas a comment made in front of several witnesses or similar notable demonstration (at \nleast to those who know what to look for). Obviously, some Negative Traits such as \nLame may require a more continuous effort to portray -don’t hesitate to use them \nfor their full dramatic effect! \nFLAWS \nFlaws showcase specific shortcomings or problems a vampire may have. These \nare deficiencies or character weaknesses that go beyond those denoted by Negative \nTraits. As with Negative Traits, Flaws are compensated with additional Free Traits \nfor the Flawed character. Each Flaw has a point value assigned to it, ranging from one \nto seven Traits. The higher the point value, the more severe the Flaw. A character \ncan take up to sevenTraits in Flaws, subject to Storyteller approval. While characters \nare welcome to take more Flaws than that, without taking so many as to become a \nparody of a character, they receive no compensation for Flaws that go beyond the \nseven-Trait limit.

For \nexample, many anarch groups do not tolerate those with Infectious Bite; a Typhoid \nMary spreading disease is a liability for the Masquerade and any group of active \nanarchs. Likewise, some Flaws simply don’t fit the standard view of anarch activity \n- \nfor instance, the nomadic unlife typical of an anarch means that few can afford \nto be Territorial. It isn’t impossible to have these Flaws, just a bit unlikely - \nindeed, \nif a clever anarch can find a way to turn her Flaw into a weapon for the Cause, she \nmay earn additional respect from her peers. \nConversely, some Flaws are fairly common among anarchs. An Enemy is easily \nallowable as a Flaw, as is Notoriety, Hunted or Sire’s Resentment. However, the \nStoryteller should work to ensure that characters are taking these Flaws for valid \nreasons, and also that they reflect something more than just generally “being an \nanarch.” For instance, given their radical affiliation, many young anarchs could \nprobably take the Sire’s Resentment Flaw, so it is perfectly within the Storyteller’s \nright to demand that it reflect something more aggressive or actively detrimental in \nterms of anarch characters. Likewise, Notoriety is a commonly overused Flaw for \nanarchs - \nunless the game is taking place in a particularly repressive area (with \nsuitably dire repercussions for the one marked by this Flaw), simply being known as \nan anarch generally isn’t enough to warrant the Notoriety Flaw. The Storyteller may \nrequire the anarch who wishes to take the Notoriety Flaw to be linked - \neven if only \nby rumor and innuendo - \nto a shocking scandal, vicious attack or similar incident \nin addition to his “scandalous” anarch status. In the end, Storytellers are highly \nencouraged to decide which Flaws they want to permit in their games, especially in \ngames primarily or entirely composed of anarchs. \nDFRANGFMFNTS \nYou can also choose Derangements for your character at this time, each of which \nis worth two Free Traits. All Malkavians must have a Derangement as part of that \nclan’s innate mental instability, which is always considered “active” and for which \nthey receive no Free Traits (though they may take additional Derangements and \nreceive Free Traits for them as normal). Derangements cause unpredictable and \nuncontrollable behavior at times, and the Storyteller is justified in asking you to \nspend Experience Traits to “buy off any Derangement that is not roleplayed \nproperly. You should always work with the Storyteller before deciding to take a \nDerangement. A Derangement is not just a funny quirk, irritating tendency or \nhabitual eccentricity - \nthose are represented by Flaws, Negative Traits or just plain \nroleplaying. A Derangement represents a true, serious mental illness on the part of \nthe character, and isn’t something that can be easily dealt with or brushed aside. \nBottom line: If you can’t handle the fact that your character’s Derangement can and \nalmost certainly will make her unlife difficult and/or wreck her carefully laid plans \nat a critical moment in the future, don’t choose a Derangement. \nMore vampire-specific Derangements are listed on page 212 of Laws of the \nNight. Subject to Storyteller approval, additional Derangements are listed on page \n72 of Laws of the Hunt and page 259 of Laws of the Reckoning. \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n46 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

It may be \nfinesse, it may just be the will to survive, but they have honed their Disciplines and \nare creative, if still very careful, in using them to achieve their noble and idealistic \ngoals. One of the few things anarch and Camarilla vampires agree upon is the \nMasquerade, and cleaning up after their own messes when it is accidentally (or \nnecessarily) breached is of the utmost importance to both sides. \nPFRSPFCTIVFS \nON DISCIPLINES \nAnimalism \nTeachers for Animalism are often sought after by anarchs, though anarchs use \nthis Discipline somewhat differently than the Gangrel and Nosferatu. A nomadic \ngang favors the use of Beckoning to gather animals for feeding on them. Animals may \nnot be the best eats, but beggars can’t be choosy, and having a food source come to \nyou can mean the difference between continued unlife and Final Death for a \ndesperate anarch. Feral Whispers is often used to create a source of information from \nanimals who have eyes and ears in places an anarch cannot or will not go.

Drawing Out the Beast is most oftenused indire straits, \nwhen an anarch is about to blow her top and can’t afford to, but the Discipline can \nalso suddenly make another vampire’s human servant turn on his master or otherwise \ncreate a bit of domestic havoc. While the disturbance may be traced to the anarch \nby perceptive Kindred, said Kindred may still be forced to injure or kill a valued \nretainer in the throes of such a frenzy, making any victory over the anarch a costly \none.

It is not quite as reliable as actually becoming an \nanimal, as allowed by the Protean Discipline, but it does the job almost as effectively. \nAuspex \nAnarchs most frequently use Auspex Disciplines as a means of augmenting their \noften meager security measures, or performing investigations into vampiric matters \nwhere mortal means simply aren’t adequate. Aside from their more obvious benefits, \nHeightened Senses, Aura Perception and Telepathy all have valuable uses in catching \nwind of various plots or interrogating others with improved accuracy.

Celerity is a valued Discipline to learn and is often \ntaught as part of a trade for much-needed gear or knowledge among the anarch \ncommunity.

Nonetheless, most anarchs give these vampires a wide berth, never sure \nwho the broken ones might decide to “gift” with madness next. \nDominate \nAlthough they would dearly love to turn this Discipline, one of the enemy’s ‘ most \nhated tools, against the sects themselves, most anarchs admit that it’s simply not \npossible. As the Movement is still predominantly comprised of neonates and \nthinner-blooded ancillae, their potential to use Dominate is limited to other vampires \nof high generation, making it an ineffective weapon against the elders, at least \ndirectly. However, in response the anarchs have long honed their use of Dominate \nagainst another rich class of targets - \nmortals, especially those employed by the \nenemy. Equipped with a list of names and faces, a clever and subtle wielder of \nDominate can gradually undermine an enemy’s Contacts, Allies, Retainers, Herd or \neven whole Influence Ratings through the use of repeated well-placed commands and \nsuggestions; while such deterioration can take a long time to pull off, doing so remains \none of the most powerful forms of attack at the anarchs’ disposal. Of course, this \nDiscipline also has more direct applications, such as wrenching information from a \ntarget or gaining access to areas guarded only by mortals (such as the haven when the \nmaster is away). However, many younger or more idealistic anarchs do noi: take \nkindly to uses of Conditioning or Possession, as these remove free will and the (desire \nfor self-determination from the individual so affected. These anarchs see such powers \nas a sign of cowardice, employed by elders desperate to control those around them or \nafraid to risk their own bodies, and watch fellow anarchs with these Disciplines \nclosely for signs of abuse. Last but not least, Forgetful Mind is a perpetual favorite, as \nit makes feeding and even well-executed hit-and-fade operations a whole lot easier \nto pull off without attracting undue attention. \nFortitude \nAnarchs often seek teachers for Fortitude, a useful Discipline to have when \nfacing the many enemies with whom revolutionaries are bound to clash in their \ncontentious unlives. Beyond its simple survival value, however, Fortitude is often an \nexcellent rallying point for young firebrands and gang leaders - \nparticularly bold \ndisplays of Fortitude when the odds are against the anarchs have been known to turn \nthe tide of more than one battle, not to mention helped form the basis for the \nuniquely anarch combination Discipline of Give ‘Em Hell (outlined later in this \nchapter). By contrast, many canny leaders of the Movement begin training in \nFortitude not long after assuming their positions, as they are only too aware of‘their \nexcellent value as targets for assassination or intimidation by the Sword of Caine or \nthe archons of the Camarilla. Some younger members scoff that this is the exact same \nline of reasoning that leads sect elders to hide from the world and manipulate from \nthe shadows, but if the irony of this position bothers anarch adherents of Fon:itude, \nit has yet to change their outlook on the subject. \nCHAPILRTWO: TAKING UP THL Ficm \n51 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Naturally, for \nthosevampires who live ina sect’sdomain the increasedability to lie low that this Discipline \noffers is a true blessing, while vandals and brawlers value it for extra ease of escape in the wake \nof their misdeeds. While it is too easily pierced to have much value in long-term infiltration, \na well-timed use of Musk ofa Thousand Faces can do a lot to sow confusion, gain access to \nrestricted areas or even frame a particularly incautious or unpopular individual. Indeed, \nprovided there are no video cameras or other recording devices to put the lie to the account \nof eyewitnesses later on, Obfuscate can go a long way toward making another Kindred’s \nunlife quite uncomfortable, and more than one anarch gang has profited from the chaos \nsurrounding the indictment of a prominent sect member for some crime. Another popular \nvariant is to use Obfuscate to appear as a target and ensure that one is seen in the area of a \nvicious attack or other scandalous activity; this often works as well or better at incriminating \nmore powerful vampires in the eyes of their peers, as the implied connection established by \nthe target’s mere presence is often much harder to disprove than the commission of an actual \ncrime, especially to the naturally suspicious Kindred. \nObtenebration \nLasombra anarchs are rare in general, and even more rare are those willing to \nteach their mastery of shadows to outsiders for anything less than a truly exorbitant \nprice. As such, in the Movement this Discipline is primarily employed for its combat \napplications, although canny anarchs sometimes use its simple presence to deflect \nsuspicion onto the Sabbat when taking action in Camarilla territories. Given the \nscarcity of Lasombra anarchs, this ruse is often quite effective, though not without \nrisk - \nthe so-called “true” Lasombra of the Sabbat will often go to great lengths to \ntrack down their wayward brethren, especially those who make trouble for the sect, \nand attempt to “convert” them to the teachings of the Sword of Caine. \nPotence \nMight sometimes makes right, or at least can even the odds a little bit, and more \nthan a few young anarchs seek out Potence for the powerful edge it offers in close \ncombat. Even older anarchs still find many uses for this Discipline beyond crude \ncrushing and smashing - \nmany find that just the threat of using this Discipline is \nenough to force an opponent to submit, particularly if given a suitably impressive \ndemonstration beforehand. It is also an excellent Discipline for those who wish to be \nheard at an anarch Rave -when \nyou can clear your own path to the podium (or push \nback those who would take it from you), you can ensure that a lot more people hear \nyour message! However, those anarchs with obviously superhuman levels of strength \nare monitored closely by their more attentive comrades, simply because the Potence \nwielder can easily break the Masquerade without realizing it, not to mention draw \nunwanted attention by accidentally injuring or killing mortals in what would \nnormally be a minor confrontation for one with lesser strength. While blatant \ndisplays of Potence might impress the neonates or liven up a battlefield, wiser anarchs \nrealize that short of all-out war, this Discipline is best used subtly, a vampiric variant \nof “walk softly and carry a big stick” diplomacy. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n52 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

What’s more, Pwsence \nis one of the few “social” Disciplines effective against elders of lower generation, \nalthough it is best employed carefully against such canny targets unless one deliber- \nately intends to provoke their ire. Indeed, the older or more politically involved an \nanarch happens to be, the more likely she is to see beyond the immediate and thus \nmore artificial lovebate applications of Presence in favor of using more subtle \napplications to bolster her natural efforts to gain lasting allies or conneci-ions. \nSummon has a number of creative uses for those interested in setting up meetings or \neven ambushes, particularly if one can summon a target to a place he would normally \ngo anyway - \nafter all, with a large enough welcoming party, the anarchs can a1 ways \ntake their quarry elsewhere if they desire.

Eyes of the Beast allows the anarch to take \nadvantage of full darkness when fighting opponents, learning Earth Meld eliminates \nthe need for a temporary haven or body bag while on the road or entering hostile \nterritory, and Feral Claws gives an anarch access to powerful weaponry no mm3tter \nwhere he goes. Indeed, even the threat of the vicious damage dealt by FeralClaws has \nturned back weaker enemies in the past, and combined with any measure of Poience \nor Celerity (or both), they make an anarch truly terrifying in combat.

Silence of Death gives an anarch pack a clear advantage when \nthings turn violent, and is frequently used around the real target of a raid while the \nrest of an Assamite’s gang makes as much noise as possible at a different target, in \norder to further mask the use of this Discipline. Of course, Scorpion’s Touch, Baal’s \nCaress and Taste of Death all ensure that an Assamite never runs out of devastating \nkilling tools to have at her disposal. Surprisingly enough, Dagon’s Call sees the most \nuse by Assamite anarchs -while \nits value against other vampires is quite consider- \nable, its real worth comes out in blackmail and extortion against another Kindred’s \nmortal contacts. Few mortals think anything of shaking hands with a pleasant if \nslightly mysterious stranger, after all, but while the internal damage inflicted on \nvictims of this insinuative Discipline may be little more than an annoyance to the \nKindred, it can prove fatal to mortals. Even the short time the Discipline lasts \nactually works to the Assamite’s advantage, since it tends to panic a Kindred whose \nretainer is at stake and force her to make decisions before she has examined all her \noptions - \nan excellent way of keeping a normally cautious elder off balance. \nThaumaturgy \nFew anarchs have any real grasp of Thaumaturgy and those who do know it are \nmistrusted as much as if not more than their Camarillapeers. Blood is the sustenance \non which all vampires depend, after all, and those able to manipulate it with \nThaumaturgy make most Kindred more than a little uncomfortable, anarchs in- \ncluded. Those with a talent for it often find themselves stymied by a lack of magical \nresources and teachers, making advancement torturously slow and prone to many \nfrustrating dead ends and experimental failures along the way. Obsessed as most are \nwith avoiding capture, many anarch Thaumaturgy users eschew the more blatant \n(and noticeable) offensive powers it offers in favor of primarily defensive rituals and \nother passive magics, such as Deflection of the Wooden Doom and Defense of the Sacred \nHauen. Naturally, even the brutal conditions under which these so-called “gutter \nmages” exist cannot suppress the spark of mystical creativity that powers this \nDiscipline, and over time a number of new rituals and other tricks unique to the \nanarchs have been cautiously circulated by those few free Thaumaturgy users in the \nMovement. In addition, while exceptions exist, anarchs are generally limited to the \nmost common paths of Thaumaturgy, since the Tremere zealously track down those \nwho display any facility with the rarer forms of magic, and the forces they send out \nto “discipline” such rogues have no problem storming a communal haven and \nincinerating everyone they find in order to accomplish their mission. This goes \ndouble for those known to teach Thaumaturgy to outsiders, especially those in \npossession of the new rituals devised by anarch magicians, and an unofficial code of \n“death before capture” has arisen between all anarch Thaumaturgy wielders. Given \nwhat the Tremere are likely to inflict on them, this is a sensible policy indeed. \nCOMBINATION \nDISCIPLINES \nOver the centuries, many anarchs have discovered innovative ways to use the \npowers of their vampiric blood, much as their rivals in the sects have done.

Wise anarchs who come across the secrets of these combination \nDisciplines hold them in reserve until they are absolutely necessary, as they reprlesent \none of the few edges unique to the Cause; the less the enemy is allowed to know cl \nr b out \nthem, the better. \nListed for each combination Discipline is an Experience Trait cost and the \nprerequisite Disciplines a character must possess before he can attempt to master this \nnew power. Characters who fail to meet either of these requirements cannot even \nattempt the feats described - \nthose who have the prerequisite Disciplines but who \nhave not spent the necessary Experience Traits lack the necessary understanding to \nperform what the combination Discipline entails. It is also within a Storyteller’s \ndiscretion to disallow any or all of these combination Disciplines. While intended to \nexpand roleplaying opportunities and demonstrate the heights vampiric power can \nreach with suitable effort and dedication, they can also be abused by power-hungry \nand unscrupulous players, and the Storyteller should always ensure that the needs of \nthe story and the game as a whole come before a few lines on a character sheet. \nThese combination Disciplines cannot be taken at character creation, regardless \nof what a character’s backstory might be; all combination Disciplines require an in- \ncharacter teacher and ideally should only be earned after a suitable period of extensive \ninvestigation and painstaking experimentation. It is therefore highly recommended \nthat the requisite Experience Traits for a combination Discipline not be spent all at \nonce, but rather spent over a period of time to reflect the student’s efforts to master her \nnew power. Not only does that evocatively demonstrate to the player the amount of \ntime it takes to master these complex Disciplines, but it also keeps the new Discipline \nfrom seeming to “magically appear” on a character’s sheet between one game and the \nnext, and encourages the acquisition of it to become part of the character’s personal \nstoryline. In addition, Storytellers should remember that required teachers are rare, and \nfew anarchs possess such unique variations to the standard Disciplines. Finding a \nsuitable instructor can easily be the goal of a fairly long storyline involving of a number \nof expensive favors, thorough investigation and personal growth. \nNote: For purposes of power comparison, a combination Discipline is consid- \nered to be the same level as the highest-level Discipline it requires to learn.

In other cases, it is much more severe - \nthe target’s Beast \nactually comes to the surface, altering her appearance into a beast-human hybrid \ncapable of causing panic in mortals and the weak-willed. \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKING UP THE FIGHI \n55 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The Storyteller has the final say on whether or not \nan animal aspect is appropriate and approves the appearance of the manifestation. \nA Ventrue loan shark may appear to have a multitude of teeth, making his predatory \nnature plain, while a clever and unscrupulous Nosferatu who has wronged the anarch \nmay appear as a fox with large ears and a pointy muzzle, or a brutal and repressive \nCamarilla scourge might manifest his inner creature by taking on the snout of a pig. \nIf the victim has less than three permanent Willpower Traits, he literally appears \nas a “beast-man” and will cause Delirium in non-supernatural creatures, just as if they \nhave seen a werewolf.. . or worse.

Weapons that \nmerely slash or hack such as swords or axes are unaffected by this power, unless the \nattacker is specifically attempting to impale the vampire with them (such as trying \nto stab the vampire through the heart). Additionally, the increased resistance \nconferred while this power is active allows the user to spend a stamina-related \nPhysical Trait to receive a retest on any staking tests (including the two additional \ntests required to stake successfully). Only one Physical Trait may be spent per test, \nhowever. Staking attacks that inflict no damage after this and other powers reduce \ndamage do not receive a chance to stake the vampire. The Storyteller is the final \njudge over whether Badger’s Hide is effective against aparticular form of attack.

The Animalism Discipline \nattunes the user to any creature that harbors a Beast, and the Auspex aspect of this \npower permits him to interpret that sensation and extend his senses beyond his \nnormal limits.

This trigger causes the Derangement to become active and the target \nsuffers a full-blown attack of the implanted Derangement. Until it is triggered, the \nsubject does not suffer from the Derangement, and is not even aware of its presence \nunless it is somehow brought to his attention (such as a particularly dedizated \nTelepathy or Forgetful Mind search).

The target’s \nmemory replaces the disappearance with the most logical alternative it can create, \nsuch as imagining that a mortal police officer fell or jumped off a bridge rather than \nhaving been pushed by the user of this Discipline. The target will strongly resist \nattempts to convince her otherwise, since her mind has created a believable \nreplacement for the missing memory. Even direct evidence to the contrary will be \ngreeted with deep skepticism. \nThis Discipline requires the expenditure of a Blood Trait and a Mental Trait, \nand the user must make aSocialTest against the target, retesting withsubterfuge. The \nuser may attempt to influence more than one target in a scene, but must spend Traits \nand test against each target individually; she cannot make agroup challenge with this \npower. If successful, the target not only ignores the character, but by the coming dawn \nforgets the user was ever there. Once activated, the character can take no aggressive \naction against the target and must leave within five minutes after activating the \nDiscipline, remaining out of the target’s sensory range for at least a full hour of game \nplay. Failure to stay out of sensory range, even if Obfuscated or otherwise supernatu- \nrally concealed, causes the target’s memories of the user to flood back at dawn and \nessentially ruins the use of this power. \nRemember that targets still recall any events that happened, just not the \npresence of the anarch using Memory Rift. If a target witnessed the anarch shooting \nsomeone, he will still remember the shooting - \nhis mind will simply make up \nanother suspect or even alter his memories to ensure that ‘‘I didn’t get a good look \nat him. Or her. I’m not even sure. Sorry.”The use of this Discipline can be uncovered \nwith the proper use of Dominate and similar powers that probe the memory, though \nits insinuative nature puts such seekers three Traits down on all relevant tests unless \nthey know exactly what they are looking for and/or have dealt with this Discipline \nin the past. \nLearning Memory Rift costs 5 Experience Traits. \nt\nTHE ANARCH GJIDE \n60 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Few anarchs possessed knowledge of the Quietus Discipline, but a handful did, \nand developed this potent Discipline to aid in conserving their passionate blood. \nThese modern nights, few anarchs know Quietus, and even fewer have ever heard of \nthis exceedingly rare combination Discipline. However, when employed its effects \nare spectacular, as Retain the Quick Blood allows a Kindred to conserve her precious \nvitae without spending it as liberally as is normally required to fuel Celenty. \nAny Blood Traits spent to activate Celerity (and only Celerity) return to the \ncharacter’s system in one full hour. Blood Traits returned in this manner can never \nexceed the character’s maximum Blood Trait pool, and any excess returning Traits \nare lost. The vitae returns due to astrange anomaly in the Kindred’s biology, the same \nanomaly that makes Assamite blood so unique and deadly. This Discipline’s use is not \nvisible to onlookers. This Discipline does not bestow an unlimited supply of vitae on \nits user, as it takes time to regain the expended Blood Traits, and hunger frenzy i s  still \narisk in combat when avampire pushes her limits using Disciplines that require blood \nto fuel them. \nStorytellers should keep a close eye on those seeking to learn this Discipline - \nit \nis exceedingly rare even for a combination Discipline, and those few Assamite anarchs \nwho know its secrets never impart it without asking a high price in return.

One such use is Sensory Overload, an offensive Discipline that \ncombines the paranormal phenomena perceived by Auspex with the madness and \ndelusions spread through Dementation. This Discipline allows a Kindred to force his \nAuspex powers upon another, but the sensory or mental input of the Auspex is twisted \nby the Dementation. The user cannot control the precise effects of this Discipline; \nwhile he may choose the level of Auspex he wishes to “bestow” on his target in hopes \nof inspiring a particular response, the exact effects generated are entirely within the \nStoryteller’s discretion. By the same token, this Discipline always manifests in a \nmanner that is distracting, painful or socially dangerous for the target; while she may \ncertainly believe she is learning something genuinely valuable, this Discipline never \ngenerates a beneficial result for the target. \nTo active this Discipline, the user must choose a target and make a successful \nSocial Test, retested by Empathy, and spend a Willpower Trait.

Note that the Malkavian wielding this power (for no other clan \nhas yet braved the excruciating process of learning this Discipline) retains full \ncommand of Auspex during this time - \nhe does not truly “loan” his power to the \ntarget, only a fractured, horrifying reflection of it. \nRegardless of the specific effects generated, all targets of Sensory Overload suffer a \ntwo-Trait penalty to all Social and Mental tests for the duration of the power due to the \nconstant distraction from this phantom input, and are required to roleplay their \ndisorientation and mistaken impressions to the best of their capability. At the \nStoryteller’s discretion, particularly susceptible targets such as those with Acute Senses, \nrelevant Derangements or other specific “weak points” for this power to exploit might \nbe required to spend a Willpower Trait to avoid being overcome with sensory input, \nor even suffer an active Derangement for the duration of the Discipline. While these \nperceptions may certainly shock the target, even those who have a compelling reason \nto disbelieve the false input they’re offered still can’t bring themselves to ignore it, and \nthose less knowledgeable in psychic manipulation are likely to either believe in the \nvisions they are granted or at best believe they are suffering some kind of psychotic fit. \nTargets who already possess the level of Auspex targeted by Sensory Overload may make \na Mental Test with the Awareness Ability against the user’s Mental Traits to discern \nthat something is wrong with their perceptions, but otherwise they are even more likely \nto believe their perceptions than most targets, accustomed as they are to receiving such \nsupernatural sensory information. \nIt costs 8 Experience Traits to learn Sensory Overload. \nSeventh Chinese Brother \nPrerequisites: Intermediate Celerity, Elder Fortitude (Personal Armor) \nOnce upon a time in China, there were seven brothers, and each one had a \nspecial natural ability.

This Discipline allows the user to emulate that seventh Chinese \nbrother by hardening one part of his body and improving the entire body’s recupera- \ntive properties so that the user’s limbs cannot be severed or her flesh punctured. \nAnarchs employing this Discipline most often use it to save their own heads, quite \nliterally, but it works just as well on a hand, arm, leg or foot, should the need arise to \nprotect these extremities. \nTo activate the power, the user must spend a Willpower Trait and select a single \nappendage. (The neck and head count as a single appendage for purposes of this \nDiscipline.) The next blow that should sever that appendage is then ignored and does \nno damage, nor does the victim of the strike suffer any penalty. The power can be \nreactivated at the beginning of the next turn to prevent loss of the head or limb. As \nlong as the user has Willpower Traits, she can protect herself in this fashion.

Jack did his trick and the scourge turned on his loyal lieutenant while Jack \nescaped laughing into the night. The lieutenant was turned to ash and the scourge \nwas disgraced, as he lost a highly esteemed lieutenant and let a known fugitive escape \nin the process. This Discipline uses Obfuscate to trick the mind and senses and uses \nDominate to further confuse someone into believing that the user is another person \nin the immediate vicinity. The user can apparently switch identities with any person \nwithin 10 steps of her. \nSmiling Jack’s Trick requires a Mental Test against the person the user intends to \ndeceive (not the person whose appearance she intends to switch); it may be used \nagainst multiple targets with a regular group test, although the user may only switch \nidentities with one person at a time. If successful, the person with whom the user \nswitched takes on the user’s appearance, while the anarch himself assumes the other’s \nappearance down to the smallest detail. This identity shift lasts for one hour, time \nthat is generally best spent leaving the area before the ruse is discovered. Like all \nDominate effects, it can only be used against a target of equal or higher generation. \nSmiling Jack’s Trick costs 9 Experience Traits to learn. \nSuck It Up \nPrerequisites: Basic Animalism, Advanced Protean \nAnarchs are no strangers to spilled blood, whether their own or that of those they \ntangle with.

The last \nthing a vampire wants is to be seen voraciously licking the sidewalk like an ice cream \ncone or looming over the body of a fallen comrade drinking the remains of her vitae. \nKindred are advised to employ Suck It Up discreetly, as use of this Discipline is \nobviously not normal or natural. \nA Kindred using this Discipline merely touches the pool of blood and absorbs it \nlike a sponge at a rate of one Trait per turn.

The \n“vacuuming up” does not do the job perfectly; telltale stains remain (though faint), \nand the dried husks of bloodless bodies certainly constitute a major Masquerade \nbreach.

Few anarch Tremere have \nmastered the Discipline or even possess a particularly advanced understanding of it, \nand so very few new rituals exist.

      "text": "BASIC RITUALS \nBanish Big Brother \nThis thoroughly modern ritual allows the thaumaturge to detect and potentially \nnullify technological eavesdropping devices -microphones, \ntape recorders, surveil- \nlance cameras and so on. In addition to normal ritual requirements, the caster must \nalso completely bum a captured representation of himself such as a picture or vocal \nrecording; additional participants in the ritual must bring their own items to be \nconsumed in this fashion. When the items are completely destroyed, recipients must \nsprinkle the remains over themselves for the ritual to take effect. Until the next \nsunrise, those affected by this ritual automatically feel a buzzing sensation along the \nbacks of their necks any time they are taped or monitored by such devices, as well as \nsensing the general nature of the machine (listening, watching, recording, etc.) and \nits approximate location relative to the ritual recipient. The ritual does not reveal if \nanyone is operating the device, however, nor does it impart any working knowledge \nof how to use or disable it. \nOnce a Kindred is aware of the attempted surveillance, he may spend a Mental \nTrait to temporarily disable the devices involved. Simple technology such as tape \nrecorders or ATM cameras malfunction automatically; disabling more complex \nsystems or remote devices may also require a Mental Test (retest Security), at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. Affected items become hopelessly inoperative until the end \nof the scene, at which time they resume functioning normally. Disabling an item is \nconsidered “pre-emptive” to it recording the user in any way; if a photographer is \nwaiting in the bushes and leaps out to take a surprise picture of the Kindred, the \nritualist still gets a normal test to attempt to disable the camera before a picture is \ntaken. Magical technology or sentient devices cannot be disabled with this ritual, \nthough the thaumaturge will still be aware of them. \nThis ritual does not allow the Kindred to deactivate such devices at will; the \nrecipient cannot cause a person’s camera to malfunction if the person is taking a \npicture that didn’t include the Kindred, for example. Any such devices targeted must \nbe actively recording the recipient in order to be subject to this ritual, whether they \nwere intended to capture her or not. \nFlatline \nAfter incantations and ritual gestures, the ritualist causes a mortal to exhibit no \nsecondary characteristics of being alive. This ritual works on willing and unwilling \ntargets alike, and is a terrifying way of threatening one of the ritualist’s enemies. \nVictims have no pulse and no breath, and this apparent state of death also extends \nto mechanical devices regardless of how simple or complex. A heart monitor or \nelectrocardiogram will show the flat line of the ritual’s name, mirrors will not fog up \nwith breath, a stethoscope will hear only silence and so on. Even if stabbed or shot, \nthe mortal’s blood will not flow; it merely trickles out and wells up into a congealed \npool around the wound (though actual damage inflicted does not change). This \npower lasts until the sunrise after the night it is cast. It has no effect on supernatural \nbeings. To empower this ritual, the caster must place a small dead insect or animal \nsomeplace in the subject’s home.

Similar to the Fortitude Discipline, Iron Body makes Kindred tougher. For \nevery 10 minutes spent performing this ritual, with a maximum of 40 minutes spent \ncasting it, the effect lasts one hour, and one level of aggravated damage sustained \nwithin that period is converted to lethal damage instead. Thus, a character who \nperformed this ritual for 40 minutes would be under its protection for four hours, \nduring which time up to four levels of aggravated wounds would be converted to \nlethal damage. Additional levels of aggravated damage inflicted beyond that amount \nor after the ritual ends are unaffected, and this ritual may not be performed again until \nthe first ritual has expired. Note that this ritual must be performed during in-game \ntime - \nif you want to show up with it on, you must show up at least 40 minutes after \nplay begins (or for however long you want your character to have done the ritual), \nor take an uninterrupted break of up to 40 minutes during play while performing the \nritual.

It was intended to allow the ritualist \nto completely block supernatural means of eavesdropping in the same fashion as its \ncousin disables surveillance devices, but unfortunately unknown enemies destroyed \nthe Warlock before he could complete his work. To enact this ritual, the caster must \ndrain a Blood Trait and cast it into a fire fueled by personal documents or recordings; \ncopies will suffice, but they must be the caster’s own work. After the fire dies down, \nthe ritualist must anoint her forehead, each eye and each ear with the ashes that \nremain, leaving small telltale black marks for those who know what to look for - \nthough given the rarity of Anarch Thaumaturgy, few do. \nUntil the next sunrise, the ritual recipient feels a sharp pain in her eyes, ears or \nforehead whenever another individual uses Supernatural powers to actively spy on \nher, thus allowing her to end her conversation before giving away valuable secrets or \nhide whatever secret materials the hidden observer was after. The user also discovers \nthe type of attempted surveillance - \nlistening, watching, telepathic contact, etc. \nHowever, unlike Banish Big Brother, this ritual does not block these powers in any way, \nnor does it offer any clues about where they are coming from or the identity of the \nobserver; it only alerts the character to their use. Likewise, this ritual does not protect \nagainst supernatural powers that do not directly spy on the user; for example, it will \nnot detect a Nosferatu using Obfuscate to stand in the comer and listen to what is \nbeing said, because Obfuscate is not providing him with any information.

Last but not least, it does not block \nconventional eavesdropping - \nif the ritualist is careless enough to let someone \noverhear or otherwise spy on him directly, that’s his own problem. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, particularly mighty elders or similarly powerful \ncreatures may be immune to this ritual, though this should be rare and reserved for \nthose who have specifically cultivated their talents at Supernatural surveillance, or \nelse this ritual quickly loses its usefulness. \nHell’s Calling \nBurning someone’s personal item when enacting this ritual causes that person to \nimmediately succumb to Rotschreck, regardless ofwhether any flame is present and what \nthe target was doing when the ritual was enacted. This ritual requires 30 minutes of time \nto perform and an iron brazier. In the past this ritual was used to humiliate enemies by \nforcing them to act like irrational lunatics and even break the resolve of opposition forces \nat a critical moment. This fear frenzy is identical to Rotschreck in nearly every way and \ncan be warded off or controlled with the usual Willpower or Courage/Self-Control tests. \nIf the target fails the test, he is seized by supernatural panic and runs away screaming, \nknockingdownanyoneinhispathwithoutgivingany \nindicationofwhat isterrifying him; \nhowever, the fear triggered by this ritual is not like normal Rotschreck in that the victim \nof Hell’s Calling can calm down immediately once away from the environment where the \nterror gripped him. Of course, the victim has no idea why he suddenly feared for his very \nunlife, which in itself can be bad enough for image-conscious elders. \nWard Versus Vitae \nAfter anointing an object with a sigil drawn in the user’s own blood while chanting \nmystical words, this anarch-specific ritual wards against more powerful Cainites. This ritual \nis commonly used to protect the caster from the unwelcome intrusion of elder vampires, \nmaking it a shared defense of many communal Free Tremere havens. This is not a “Ward \nversus Kindred,” but rather a specific ward against those of more potent blood. It can be cast \non any single object from dagger- to door-sized. It causes one Trait of lethal damage to any \nKindred of lower generation than the caster who crosses the threshold of the doorway or \ntouches the object. This damage bypasses armor and even other mystical protections. So if \nan eleventh-generation anarch inscribes the sigil on his haven door, Kindred of tenth or \nlower generation suffer the pain of breaking the ward. It is otherwise considered a normal \nward, and lasts until the night after inscribing it.

This frlmzy is \nalmost identical to regular frenzy, with several notable exceptions. First, those under the \nsway of this Discipline will naturally target the “enemies” described by the elder and need \nnot fear attacking each other in their rage, though other threats may temporarily draw their \nattention away from their target.

Essentially a more potent version of the Earth C:on~rol \nDiscipline, Turnabout requires two Blood Traits to activate. The elder sinks into the \nground and instantly emerges behind or to the side of an enemy in her line of sight; the \nplayer decides exactly where her character intends to resurface, although the user \ncannot resurface directly under a person. If the character chooses, she may remain in \nthe ground for a period of time, but then the vampire is using Earth Control instead of \nTurnabout. Turnabout’s focus is on dropping down into the ground and popping up in \na more advantageous location, thereby catching an opponent by surprise. \nThis Discipline grants the user an automatic Surprise attack against an oppo- \nnent, regardless of any Celerity, Auspexor other powers related to speed or supernatural \nperception the opponent may possess. Such is the nature of the Surprise that the \ntarget is considered at a three-Trait penalty to defend himselffrom the elder’s attacks. \nCHAPTER \nTwo TANK UP THE FIGHI \n69 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

They always have and, as most elders snidely assert, they always will. \nYet despite this chaotic factionalism, somehow the ideals of the Anarch Revolt \nmanage to stay alive, even gain ground from time to time, to the frustration and \ndismay of Camarilla manipulators and Sabbat tacticians alike. For what makes the \nanarchs so maddeningly difficult to organize also makes them virtually impossible to \nstamp out; indeed, the more pressure their enemies apply, the more popular these foes \nfind the Movement becoming.

Most important of all, do not assume that rebellious \nbehavior indicates sympathy for anarch goals. (This is particularly true regarding petty \nvandalism or similar acts of mindless violence.) An elder attempting to seize praxis is \ncertainly a rebel - \nat least by the standards of his peers - \nand will be punished \naccordingly if he fails. He is not, however, an anarch, nor is he sympathetic to anarch \ngoals. On the contrary, he might very well believe the current prince has been entirely \ntoo indulgent regarding the local revolutionaries and intend to “crack down” on them \nas soon as he becomes the new prince. If so, the anarchs would do well to keep the \ncurrent prince on the throne unless the would-be ruler’s iron-fisted policies would \nultimately result in a net gain of new recruits with valuable resources for the struggle. \nSimilarly, a well-groomed neonate tagging an elder’s favorite gallery, museum or \ntheater with obscene graffiti is apoor example of an anarch at best. She has no particular \ncause. She makes no particular artistic or political statement. She just enjoys the \nadolescent thrill of “being naughty” and knows her sire will shield her from any truly \nserious consequences. She has no particular beef with “the System” and believes anarchs \nin general are, at best, hopelessly impractical. She might occasionally hang out with the \ntrendier “bad boys,” but she would roll on them in an instant to save her own ass. \nWhat about the stereotypical “young punks” who rumble in the Rack, bait the \nprince’s ghouls and keep the sheriff working overtime to preserve the Masquerade? \nEven such malcontents as these aren’t necessarily anarchs. “Young, dumb and full of \nattitude” accurately describes a lot of vampires on both sides of the political fence. \nThat loud-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around might be the local gang leader, \nbut he’s even more likely to be the local scourge or one of the sheriffs deputy bruisers \ntaking a night off.

More often than not, their more socially responsible comrades quietly elimi- \nnate such loose cannons before their excesses provoke indiscriminate “final solutions” \nfrom infuriated princes. It’s just like military boot camp: If the entire platoon gets \ndropped for push-ups because one problem child caught the drill sergeant’s attention, \nit ain’t the drill sergeant who gets the blanket party. \nLast but certainly not least, dissatisfaction with the status quo is not the defining \ncharacteristic of an anarch. If it were, the elders would be right: every neonate less \nthan half a century old would be an anarch. So would most neonates more than half \na century old. So would most ancillae and quite a few elders. Dissatisfaction with the \nstatus quo is natural to anyone who isn’t king of as much of the hill as interests him, \nand very few vampires are satisfied with less than a mountain. However, exactly like \nthe mortals they once were, the overwhelming majority of vampires struggle beneath \nthe burden of a system they feel utterly powerless to change. The glass ceiling is crystal \nclear but is in no way weakened by its transparency. For all their deep dissatisfaction, \nthey continue to grunt and grind their way through immortality by the rule:;. The \ndefining characteristic of an anarch, then, is not thought but action. \nANARCHDFMOGRAPHICS \nWhat follows is a cursory survey of anarchs as a whole - \nnot who they are but \nwhat they are. Some stereotyping is unavoidable, but exceptions to the rules are \nalways possible. By their very nature, anarchs do not fit neatly into pigeonholes. \nAbsolutely none of these categories is anything more than incidental to a given \nanarch. What defines him as an anarch and differentiates him from others is what he \nbelieves and, within certain very broad generalizations, he might believe anything \nregardless of his age, generation or clan. \nANARCH~RY \nAGF \nMost anarchs currently active were Embraced in the 20th century. The Anarch \nMovement is primarily a youth movement among the undead. Since the ultimate goal \nof the Movement is to seize power from the elders, it is only natural that very few \nelders dare to support it. The longer an anarch has spent as a vampire, the more of \na rarity he is. Many die before passing the century mark, or worse still burn out and \nwithdraw from the struggle, too worn down or embittered to continue. A rare few sell \nout to the Man and become the enemy, though these rarely survive the ire of their \nformer comrades-in-arms, especially if they paid for their re-admittance with the \nblood of their old allies. Even the most dedicated anarchs often have a hard time \nwatching what happens to their treasured philosophies: Ideas that were radical in \ntheir youth become merely liberal to the next generation, moderate to the generation \nafter that and are positively conservative to mortals in the years that follow. Static \ncreatures that they are, few vampires adapt well to political and social progress.

On the other, by this time they almost always have accumulated \na long list of enemies as old and as powerful as they are, if not more so. Even those whose \nreputations are beyond reproach occasionally find it difficult to retain allies among the \nneonates for whom they fight, who look on them as “out of touch” with the ideals of the day \nor even as likely sell-outs to the sects. Not that there isn’t some truth to these fears -no one \nwants to serve as cannon fodder, and in a clash between elders, a neonate can be little else. \nANARCHY \nBY GFNFRATION \nGiven the relative “youth” of most anarchs, it comes as little surprise that they \nare generally more thin-blooded compared to their sect rivals: Neonates of the \nthirteenth, twelfth and eleventh generations are the rule. That does not mean no \nanarchs of lower generation exist, though the upper ranks of the anarchs entertain \nsome curious habits when dealing with their high-generation comrades. One reason \nthese elders fear their younger counterparts is diablerie, as many of them became \n“elders by blood” during the Great Revolt when they fell upon their sires. Originally \nthey justified diablerie as an act of war against their oppressors; over half a \nmillennium later, they now find themselves in much the same situation as their sires \nonce did. They ponder the abuses and indignities that once drove them to such \nextremes, and fear their own childer might turn on them one day in similar fashion. \nAfter all, many modern anatchs still consider diablerie a fitting punishment in some \ninstances, and while it is far from condoned by the Movement as a whole, it is not \nunheard of either. It is very foolish to assume a young anarch must be a weak anarch. \nIn similar fashion to those vampires who have been with the anarchs for a long \ntime, thoseknown tobeoflow generation-whetheras theresult ofdiablerieorsimply \nbeing Embraced by an elder sire - \ntend to attract a lot of unwelcome attention. For \none thing, their peers in the other sects know precisely how dangerous those of strong \nblood are when they attain full command of their gifts, and thus will stop at nothing \nto deny such a potentially powerful asset to the rebellious neonates. And while their \ncomrades may respect their raw power, they are often viewed with much the same \nsuspicion as long-time members receive, as their fellow anarchs keep a close eye on \nthem in case it looks like they may turn to the enemy. Thus, their presence in the \nMovement is something of a two-edged sword. Though powerful individually, their \ncomrades aren’t likely to be as tough and therefore are less likely to survive the attacks \nmeant to destroy them. And since they haven’t been around as long as a true elder, they \noften lack the influence and resources to protect themselves against such attacks in the \nfirst place. Small wonder, then, that these jinxes find allies few and far between. \nANARCH~RY \nCLAN \nAs perhaps befits their origins at the Convention of Thorns, the majority of \nanarchs trace their lineage back to one of the Camarilla’s founding clans.

Even some of the rare bloodlines have found a place in the ranks of the \nrevolutionaries, though none to such a degree that they have had a widespread impact \non the Movement. Indeed, with the exception of the highly insular and vicious \nTzimisce and Giovanni clans, which go out of their way to hunt down and destroy all \nof their blood who dare to join the anarchs, no clan or bloodline is truly safe from having \nrogue members. Some produce more than others, but any vampire can “go anarch” - \nand will when pushed far enough. The Movement is not a clan phenomenon, it is a \nvampire phenomenon. Every family has children who strain at the leash. \nAnother common reason that causes neonates to spurn the traditional ways of \ntheir clans is, not surprisingly, too much pressure from their sires to be a proper little \nfill-in-the-blank in the first place. A Gangrel whose Brujah buddy taught him \nCelerity and Potence, for example, might think Fortitude and Protean are fair gifts to \nteach in return regardless of what some elder might have to say about the sanctity of \n“Ennoia’s Gift.” A Setite might think Sutekh‘s dark crusade to corrupt the world is \nsheer insanity and flee the cult at her first opportunity; Assamites might react the \nsame way to Haqim’s jyhad. Any vampire from a clan known to manipulate its \nneonates more than others might decide “toeing the clan line” is a waste of time; the \nsame goes for any neonate whose sire goes too far in trying to break her into accepting \nthe cruel truths of undead society. Life as an anarch is rough, but at least it’s ji-ee. \nCOMINGTOTHFMOVFMFNT \nANARCHS \nBY CHOICE \nThe overwhelming majority of anarchs come to the Movement of their own free will. \nFor most, it was a simple choice: spend immortality at the table waiting for the master to toss \nyou a bone, or smke out on your own. Self-respect is a powerful motivating force. Anarchs, \nfor all their faults, at least live on their feet. They very rarely have much and what they do \nhave, they had to fight claw and fang to get. They grouse a great deal about how the elders \ncontrolall the besthuntinggrounds, andhow they want to redistribute theresourcesofcities \nfairly, but this isn’t the true cause of their rebellion. In the end, when all the political and \neconomic argument is over, the propagandists have run out of rhetoric and the time finally \ncomes for absolute honesty - \nat that moment, it’s all about self-respect. \nYes, most anarchs are quite young, but there are a few elders who are still in the \nfight and have been since the 14th century. There are even more ancillae who have \nbeen in it for a quite a while themselves. Yes, most anarchs are thin-bloods, but more \nthan a few have drawn“c1oser to Caine”or have beenclose all along. Yes, there are some \ncommon clans involved, but in the end nearly every clan is represented in the \nMovement, even the stodgiest and most structured. Yes, the Camarilla is the obkious \ntarget and provides the greatest number ofrecruits, but even independent clans and the \nSabbat can push their neonates too far. Given this evidence, even elders themselves \noccasionally repent of their crimes and join the Movement.

Perhaps she offended the wrong elder and now finds herself \nstripped of even her Acknowledged standing in the eyes of the prince. Perhaps she ran \nafoul of the scourge before she could even find the prince. Whatever her reason, she \nlanded on the wrong side of the law, and she had nowhere else to go. \nIt happens. In fact, it happens so often that it’s something of a joke among many \nwho swear almost every anarch has a sob story about how the Man did him wrong. It \ndefinitely happens often enough for established anarchs to be wary of such converts, \nand rightly so. Most vampires on the run don’t consider themselves anarchs, and they \ngo right back to the enemy when their particular problem is solved. Worse, some may \neven try to take along a former ally as proof of their repentance. \nSome do stay, however, not least because they find themselves in the company \nof others who can understand what happened to them and where they’re coming \nfrom. For all their many faults, anarchs still tend to be the most open and welcoming \ntoward new recruits of all the sects, and especially for younger vampires who still \nremember their breathing days, this candor and camaraderie can be a welcome thing \nindeed. When they had nowhere else to go, the Movement took them in and treated \nthem well-or at least better than theiroid“friends”0n theother sideofthepolitical \nfence.

Both are so rare, they almost qualify as urban legends, but both have occurred \non more than one occasion. The first case involves Sabbat refugees, while the second \ncase concerns elders who become “enlightened” and join the Anarch Revolt. \nSabbat Refugees \nThough the elders of the Sabbat certainly wish it were otherwise, the Vinculum \nis neither foolproof nor eternal. Nomadic packs seldom perform the Vaulderie with \nanyone outside their own circle, and weak Vinculums guarantee little in the way of sect \nloyalty. Even founded packs can’t be expected to have the bishop present for every \nobservance, much less the archbishop. Without repeated observances, even the \nstrongest bonds fade to insignificance. Herein lies the chance for a dissident to escape. \nNot every soldier in the Great Crusade is happy to have been drafted in the first \nplace. Many have harbored dreams of desertion from that first night, and many more \nwere loyal in the beginning but began to question their commitment after becoming \nmore familiar with the sect.

They can’t take refuge in the Camarilla - \nnot that any would wanlr to - \nand they can’t go it alone, so they end up with the one group of vampires who also \ncommonly travel in “packs” and are usually damned good fighters: anarchs. Of \ncourse, their new allies are profoundly suspicious of them at first, and justifiably \nconcerned about exactly who might be coming to reclaim them, but they brinz with \nthem info and rare Disciplines too useful to be turned away. In time, the refugees \novercome the initial suspicions and prove themselves trustworthy. It is from such \nconverts as these that most “normal” anarchs learn that the elders of the Sabbat are \nno better than those of the Camarilla. \nEnlightened Elders \nSometimes, the propaganda actually works. Whether they were som’ewhat \nsympathetic to the cause in the first place, converted purely by argument or rnoved \nby the nobility of an anarch‘s personal sacrifice, some elders “see the light” and realize \nthe Movement makes a number of valid points. Of course, realizing that your enemy \nis the “good guy” is one thing; actually joining his side is quite another. Very few \nelders are willing to openly cross that line even if they have come to believe they \nshould- doing so would mean breaking the ties that have bound them for cenruries, \nand that is not an action to take lightly. But some do, and they can make all the \ndifference in the world. \nWhen neonates and ancillae switch sides, they face suspicion. When Sabbat \nrefugees switch sides, they face suspicion and considerable anxiety at the thought of \nthe direct danger that often dogs their heels. When elders of any sect switch sides, \nhowever, they face utter disbelief. Sure, many propagandists have called for the elders \nto surrender power peacefully - \nthat’s a standard and almost gratuitous lme of \nrhetoric in the speeches of emissaries and rabble-rousers worldwide. But it isn’t long \nbefore even the most optimistic recruiters generally abandon the idea of an elder \nactually doing it, so when it happens it must be a trick, some kind of ploy to set the \nanarchs up for a larger fall. Only a fool or a madman would trust someone willing to \ngive away centuries of progress and achievement, nght? \nWrong. Though certainly not all conversions have been genuine, occasionally \none is for real, and every time it happens the revolution takes one giant step toward \neventual victory. The sheer influence that such an elder brings with him staggers the \nimagination. Vampires are creatures of habit, elders most of all, and aconvertecl elder \ncan still claim prestation over those who owe him boons. You can accumulate a lot \nof boons in 700 years.

Simple. \nThat prince is the elder’s grandchilde, and their benefactor just collected on a boon \nfrom 1637.

On the other side, the Sabbat just as clearly values individual \nliberty above social order, to the point of permitting a certain amount of divisive \nfeuding rather than laying down law from above. While exceptional territories may see \nthings differently, as a rule vampires can expect the same thing in every territory ruled \nby the major sects - \nthe only difference is in the degree to which it is enforced. \nBy contrast, the Anarch Revolt occupies the proverbial middle ground between \nthe two sects. It does not do this by representing a single moderate viewpoint, \nhowever, nor do its members follow a uniform policy regarding acceptable forms of \nresistance to the status quo. Indeed, to their sectarian counterparts, “typical” anarch \nideology is a study in apparent contrasts: Most anarchs share the Sabbat’s desire for \nvampires to be free from elder rule, but also see merit in the Camarilla’s design for \nmaintaining an overall social order and avoiding a second Inquisition. Capable of \nembracing what they like from both sects while rejecting those parts they find \nrepellent, as well as injecting an amount of mortal political thought or their own ideas \ninto the mix, the anarchs take great pride in finding a better way to govern \nthemselves. Perhaps the greatest gift the Movement allows its anarchs is the freedom \nto explore issues of governance for themselves, gaining glory or suffering the \nconsequences as appropriate to the particular social experiment they endorse. \nWhat follows, then, is an overview of the ideological spectrum found within the \nMovement, from the subtle aid and encouragement of the loyal opposition within \nthe Camarilla to the mindless violence of the nihilists who exist simply to bring chaos \nand disorder to Kindred and kine alike. While these summaries represent a good \nsampling of the political impulses observed among the anarchs, it should be \nremembered that they are far from all-inclusive: A hardcore nihilist may still cling \nto a few shreds of constructionist hopes, for instance. Likewise, they are not overtly \nrecognized among the ranks of the Movement - \none does not walk up to another \nanarch and ask “Are you a Reformer?” any more than one would ask “What’s your \nNature?” While some political scholars and philosophers could in fact identify these \nideologies at work, they are not common lingo among the anarchs themselves. \nIt should also be noted that these impulses are largely predicated on opposition \nto the Camarilla and/or furthering the goals of the anarchs themselves. While the \nSabbat is certainly a concern for the anarchs, only the most irrational vampires hold \nany hope of persuading the Sabbat to change its ways short of destroying the sect \nentirely.

Their attitude toward ancillae and neonates remains one of \npaternal condescension.

While the \nMovement would suffer without the actions of the Loyal Opposition to support its efforts \nfrom time to time, without these impulses it might very well cease to exist. \n RADICAL^ \nRadicals, as a group, espouse beliefs so far outside the accepted vampiric norm \nthat many elders consider them utterly mad. Most radicals are neonates who rejpect \nonly individual achievement regardless of age, generation or clan. To them, age \ndoesn’t always grant wisdom, generation only defines the limits of superna tural \npotency and clan is merely a sociological distinction about as meaningful (or \nmeaningless) as handedness, hair color or musical taste. Some radicals even go .So far \nas to renounce any clan affiliation, becoming self-declared Caitiff. \nRadicals have a more “universalist” view than their militant comrades. Whereas \nmilitants are usually concerned only with their home areas, radicals who succes:;fully \nliberate one city often forego the boring process of consolidating their hold on power \nin order to export the revolution to neighboring cities. While they aren’t so foolish \nas to disavow violence altogether, radicals prefer to use nonviolent methods of \nspreading their ideas whenever possible, believing that in the long term such efforts \nhave a much greater potential payoff than violence. Devotion to the struggle is their \nparamount concern, not government or military action. This impulse provides the \nMovement with many of its most gifted political thinkers but very few tacticians, \nthough they make fierce (if not particularly efficient) front line fighters when called \nupon. Radicals occasionally win the war only to lose the peace. \nGenerally the youngest of anarchs, radicals are by far the most idealistic. Many \nwere activists and firebrands as mortals and simply brought their politics with them \ninto undeath. Unfazed by the Embrace, they struggle to reshape vampire society \nalong socialist, communist, anarchist or other political lines. Believing the Camarilla \nto be teetering on the brink of dissolution, they dedicate themselves to pushing it \nover the edge by any means necessary. Given opportunity, they eagerly exploit \npolitical circumstances to their benefit. Lacking opportunity, they create it by \nstirring up the populace. Despite their relative youth, they are a force to fear. \nMILITANT5 \nAs their name implies, militants are strident in their opposition to elder rule. \nMost are neonates and very young ancillae.

What defines \na militant is not a need to use force to solve problems, but the idea that some decisive \naction must be taken, and that such actions ultimately lie outside the scope of \nCamarilla law. This is also where their paths diverge from their radical comrades - \nwhile militants appreciate and often endorse a great deal of anarch ideology, they see \ndirect action as the only way to achieve lasting results. Speeches may make converts, \nbut victories make territories. \nMilitants generally support the idea of independent city-states ruled by repre- \nsentative councils, but see no reason to unify these city-states via a larger confederation \nas many radicals propose. Each city-state, they argue, should be free to deal with \nothers as it chooses based on individual inclination as well as the hard truths of \npolitical, military or economic need. Each territory should be sovereign in all \nrespects, its internal affairs considered sacrosanct against foreign interference, and \nempowered to resist those enemies who violate its sovereignty. \nMilitants expect aggression from elders for their resolute stance, and are almost \nalways ready to defend themselves and their communities with deadly force. They \nrecognize full well that compromise isn’t an option since there is no place in the \nCamarilla for them to occupy, and fight accordingly.

They \nwelcome violent confrontation on almost any terms, as means to prove their \ndevotion if not always to win battles. Unlike militants, they generally lack the \npatience to wait while the propagandists win the hearts and minds of the general \npopulace. They want their revolution, and they want it now, damn it! \nHardliners don’t just want to put the Camarilla on its knees; they want to kick it \nwhile it’sdown. They want to keep on kicking it until it begsfor mercy. Hardliners want \nthe elders to suffer all the misery and degradation that has been their lot. For many of \nthem, the struggle has nothing to do with making a better world. It’s all about getting \neven with those who wronged them. No more, no less.

While most of these groups are not truly connected to the Cause in any \nway, they are often equated with it by other vampires, and that makes them \nsomething of a concern to the anarchs whether they like it or not. This is not to say \nthat anarchs don’t occasionally find these groups useful or even outright ally with \nthem from time to time, just that as a whole anarch leaders do not consider them true \nparts of the Movement. Indeed, dealing with these groups often presents something \nof a conflict to the anarchs involved: On the one hand, these groups are committed \nto personal freedom and self-determination outside the sects, but at the same time \nnone are committed to any noble struggle for liberty and justice. \nA UTARCHS ( AUTARKI’S) \nAutarchs have a single political belief: they don’t do politics. They keep to \nthemselves, manage their own affairs and expect other vampires to do the same. They \navoid the company of other vampires lest they find themselves drawn into conflict \nof one form or another. Depending on the autarch in question, calling one an anarch \nmay even be considered fighting words - \nthese loners left everything behind to \navoid labels and social cliques, and aren’t too happy to have some punk try to do what \npressure from an entire sect couldn’t manage. While they may throw in with the \nanarchs from time to time out of common cause or mutual defense, that is about the \nextent of their involvement, and they like to keep it that way. Those who mistake \nan autarch‘s presence as indicative of some desire to join the Movement seldom make \nthe same mistake twice, one way or another. \nAt best, autarchs maintain strict neutrality, and deal with other vampires fairly \nif a bit distantly when the need requires. At worst, they feel little but contempt for \nthe Camarilla, the Sabbat and the Anarch Revolt alike, and take pleasure in showing \nsuch foolish vampires the error of their ways, painfully if necessary. Some aui-archs \nare quite young and hope to get older by not getting involved in politics, while some \nare far older than the sects they disdain, and so powerful that ignoring them and being \nignored in return has become the best option to continue with their arcane personal \nagendas. In either event, when they assume residence in a Camarilla domain, they \nseldom make more than a token appearance in front of the prince before disappearing \ninto the city or the outlying regions. Every autarch carries an aura of mystery and most \nlike it that way, to keep potential foes off guard if nothing else. \nCHA~ER \nTHREE THE ksit UNLIR \n83 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

At the same time, many anarchs \nbelieve you’re either part of the problem or part of the solution, and autarch apathy is \ndefinitely seen as part of the problem. Thus, while few actually disk autarchs, few spare \nthem much sympathy either. While they may work together when the need requires, \nboth sides know better than to expect any lasting support. \nMFRCFNARIFS \nMercenaries, like autarchs, care nothing for either sect or the anarchs who seek to \nbring those sects down. Unlike autarchs, they readily involve themselves in political \nconflicts even though they have no political motives of their own, for the sake of a \npaycheck.

They are seldom truly respected but often feared for their prowess. \nMercenaries, though not themselves interested in politics, are the source of \nconsiderable debate with those who are. Pragmatic militants and radicals see nothing \nwrong with bolstering battlefield strength with soldiers offortune, or consider doing so \ntheir only viable option given the strength of local opposition forces.

Most were criminals or problem children as mortals and simply continue \ntheir antisocial activity as vampires. Although they are a minority faction in the \nMovement, they call the most attention to themselves by their outrageous behavior. \nAs far as the rank and file of the Camarilla is concerned, all anarchs are nihilists. As \na result, nihilists find themselves fighting other anarchs as often and as savagely as \nthey fight princes, sheriffs or scourges.

It should be understood, however, that as with many rhings \nthis generalization of a “typical” anarch response is just that: a generalization. Ariarchs \nmay have widely different opinions and interpretations of these concepts beirween \ndiffering factions and even different individuals within the same faction, depending on \ntheir own personal histories and experiences. Accordingly, readers are advised to take \nthese summaries with a grain of salt before assuming that any particular anarch holds \nthe same opinions as expressed here. When especially relevant, particular factional \nobjections or interpretations have been described below. \nTHF CAMARILLA \nAs the undeniably dominant sect of vampire society, the Camarilla embodies \nthe very system anarchs strive to change. Thus, as the “laws” of that sect, the Six \nTraditions and the manner in which elders interpret and enforce them inspire the \ngreatest amount of dissident thought. \nTHE \nFIRST TRADITION: \nMASQUERADE \nOnly the most foolish or fanatical vampires deny the wisdom of hiding their very \nexistence from the teeming masses of humanity. Accordingly, almost no anarch \nobjects to the Masquerade as a general theory. Instead, they find fault in its most \ncommon application and enforcement. Considering the sophistication of modern \nforensic science and the astounding speed with which it advances, the policy of \nhiding the existence of all vampires from mortals strikes most as nothing short of \npatently absurd. Sooner or later, they believe, irreversible discovery by a government \nagency is unavoidable. \nFaced with the manifest impossibility of the Masquerade as an absolute secret, \nsome radicals propose a revolutionary but pragmatic solution: actively enlisting \nmortal aid. Selective revelation to key mortals, they argue, creates a safety net of \ninformed agents who hide vampires from mass discovery far better than they alone \ncan hide themselves. Properly administered and applied on a global scale, such an \nenlightened policy would pave the way for social acceptance of the undead when the \nMasquerade completely collapses.

      "text": "Most elders consider this approach utterly insane and ruthlessly exterminate all \nanarchs who put it into practice at any level. In their experience, the Masquerade as an \nabsolute secret is all that saved them from the fires of the Inquisition and all that stands \nbetween them and a second fiery holocaust. That secret must be kept at all costs. Mortals \n- \nany and all mortals -must remain ignorant of the monsters in their midst. Any vampire \nwho reveals the truth, whether by accident or design, must die as a lesson to others. \nElders enforce this “zero tolerance” policy so zealously that mere suspicion of \nviolation is enough to send most anarchs to greet the sun, as well as guarantee the \ndeath of their mortal associates. Better to be safe, the elders claim, than sorry. This, \naccording to the elders, is the wisdom of ages. This, according to the visionaries, is \nthe folly of inflexibility. Unable to adapt to the changing world, the elders cling \nferociously to tradition and thereby steer a direct course to what many radicals \nconsider an easily avoided doom. Ruthlessly executing those suspected of selective \nrevelation only makes matters worse. \nOn the other hand, anarchs themselves are just as brutal when handling what \nthey consider serious breaches of the Masquerade. Training a core group of trusted \nretainers to help maintain the illusion of normalcy is acceptable. Telling the entire \ndowntown party posse at a favorite club is not. Careless or casual displays of \nsupernatural power are out of the question. Real anarchs are many things, but stupid \nisn’t on the list, and wantonly spreading such dangerous information is as serious to \nthem as it is to the enemy.

Making enemies is a guaranteed way to mysteriously disappear. What \nprince will even care about amissing anarch, let alone waste valuable resources trying \nto find him? And if word on the street has it the missing moron broke the Masquerade \nprior to his disappearance, perhaps it is best for all concerned that he remainmissing. \nTHF \n~ F C O N D  TRADITION: \nDOMAIN \nDisagreement over the Second Tradition is perhaps the most fundamental issue \nof the Anarch Revolt, with the possible exception of the Fifth (see below). Again, \nit is a matter of theory versus application. To anarchs, a claim of domain over your \nhaven makes perfect sense. A prince’s claim of domain over an entire metropolis with \na million or more mortal inhabitants makes absolutely no sense at all. \nElders who were Embraced during the Middle Ages might be comfortable with \nfeudalism, but few vampires Embraced within the last three centuries truly agree with \nthe practice. The notion of “natural rights” is too much apart of their thinking, and one \nof those rights is the right to your own property, not just to hold land as a fief granted \nby one’s liege lord. Reformers, constructionists and militants are the foremost propo- \nnents of liberal politics in vampire society. They prefer to divide a metropolis equitably \namong its residents so that each resident has, if not a totally equitable share, at least \nenough room to rest and feed in safety without imposing on another’s territory. \nOf course, many radicals reject this solution as being little better than the \nfeudalism it replaces. There is no way to divide ametropolis equitably, they argue.

How should the current population accommodate new residents who \narrive after the initial division of the city? And most importantly, individual domains \npresent a difficult challenge to the Masquerade. If the same vampire hunts in the \nsame part of the city over the course of several decades, her true nature will inevitably \nbe revealed by an accumulation of evidence linking her to bizarre incidents and \noccasional assaults. To protect the Masquerade, residents must violate each other’s \ndomains. Clearly, radicals conclude, private domains are a threat to individual liberty \nbecause they create the conditions of inequity whence arises violence between the \nhaves and the have-nots. \nLiberals believe that free trade between property owners ultimately redresses \nsuch problems, but radicals contend that free trade only results in the concentration \nof more and more property in the hands of ever fewer owners. You cannot safeguard \nindividual liberty, they claim, by increasing the inequities that cause violence \nbetween individuals. Accordingly, radicals establish collective domains wherein \nmost of the city is considered the common property of all. Individuals are free to hunt \nwithin these “public reserves” so long as they keep the Masquerade. \nThe practice has so far met with only limited success in the smallest anarch \ncommunities. In the larger communities, nihilist gangs often claim turf and refuse \nhunting privileges to non-members unless paid some outlandish “tribute.” Sadly \nenough, disputes of this nature are almost always resolved violently. \nTHE THIRD \nTRADITION: \nPROGENY \nAmong anarchs, popular opinion holds that elders restrict the siring of progeny \nto maintain their grip on the reins of power. They only allow the Embrace of chlilder \nwho can be counted on to be good little fledglings and toe the party line. Since the \nprivilege of siring is so rarely doled out, and vampires Embraced without a prince’s \nofficial sanction are destroyed along with their sires, the younger generations cannot \ngrow numerous enough to pose a significant threat to the elders who oppress them. \nNeedless to say, anarchs oppose this policy as a violation of a natural right. Like \nmortal procreation, they see vampiric siring as an inalienable vampiric right. \nThe problem is that things aren’t quite that simple. Sure, elders want to prevent \na surge in the neonate population. Sure, they want to ensure the loyalty of the neonates \nwhose Embrace they permit. However, there’s more to the matter than protecting their \nhegemony. Cities are crowded enough already. Every new vampire is one more \ncompetitor for prey. W h y  create competition for the limited resources that vampires \nalready fight so savagely over? If everyone were allowed to Embrace on a whim, the \nresulting overpopulation would wreck the Masquerade and thereby condemn the \nentire vampiric race to extinction. Where would the Anarch Movement be then? \nMost older anarchs realize this. In practice, comparatively few sire progeny with \nsuch callous disregard for the Big Picture. Unfortunately for the responsible majority, \nit only takes a single bad apple to spoil the bunch, and when it comes to such an \napparently obvious “right” as siring even well-meaning anarchs can make terrible \nmistakes.

Something \nmust be done soon, but anarch leaders have severely limited options. Strict enforce- \nment of this Tradition is out of the question (the popular uproar would be deafening \n- \nand deadly). Both liberals and radicals struggle to indoctrinate their peers with a \nsense of social responsibility and a solid grasp of basic food chain economics, but this \nis astopgap measure at best. Many in the Movement are justifiablyworried. If anarchs \ncan’t resolve this issue, it will get completely out of hand - \nand either the elders or, \nworse, the humans will solve it for them. \nTHE FOURTH \nTRADITION: \nACCOUNTING \nThis Tradition also directly contradicts a fundamental belief shared by almost \nall anarchs: just as every individual is free, every individual is responsible for what he \ndoes with his freedom. It is the epitome of injustice to punish one vampire for the \nactions of another unless coercion can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \nAnarchs seldom punish a sire for the behavior of his childe. They punish the childe \ninstead. A vampire who habitually sires problematic progeny, however, is an entirely \ndifferent matter. One or two dangerous childer represent honest mistakes. Five or six \nrepresent criminal negligence, and anarchs punish such negligence accordingly. In \nall cases, sires are expected to help apprehend wayward childer and hand them over \nfor punishment. \nAdditionally, anarchs do not release their childer into vampire society, much \nless command them in all things. Too many experienced long years of servitude spent \nindentured to their own sires to ever put their childer through such nonsense. They \nteach their childer, of course, and the wisest and most responsible sires teach their \nchilder well, but they do not treat their childer like servants. Many Embrace only \nmortal friends, allies and retainers to whom they’ve already taught the basics. \nTHE FIFTH \nTRADITION: \nHOSPITALITY \nDespite accusations to the contrary, anarchs understand manners. They don’t \nbarge into each other’s havens uninvited and they conduct themselves with reason- \nable decorum while staying under another’s roof. That’s just common courtesy. \nPresenting themselves to aprince whenever they go from city to city is ridiculous and \nfew do so unless they truly fear the scourge. Again, it is an issue of natural rights (in \nthis case, the right to move from place to place without undue hindrance). That, \nhowever, is actually a relatively minor point of contention. The part that truly \noffends all anarchs is the line about being nothing without the word of acceptance. \nWhy? Simple. No prince is obligated to grant his “word of acceptance” to anyone. He \nhas the power to confirm or deny a vampire’s legal existence on a whim, and there \nexists no law to secure natural rights against misuse of that authority. This Tradition \nasserts that vampires have no rights at all, merely privileges, and they have only such \nprivileges as the prince chooses to grant. It’s a prime example of medieval thinking \nfrom medieval minds, and anarchs don’t like it. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n88 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

With the Sixth, they reserve the authority to take vampires out of the \nworld. Many doubt elders ever concern themselves much with the departed since, as \nthe saying goes, they can make many more just like the ones they destroyed. If the \nprince gives the word, that’s it - \nno appeal, no second chance, just destruction. It’s \nall far too arbitrary for anarchs because few princes ever bother to truly invesirigate \nthe crimes for which they so often call blood hunts. A rumor here, an innuendo there \nand suddenly the entire city is on your case. If you’re lucky, you manage to get out of \ntown before the sheriff tracks you down. If not, well, it was nice knowing you. \nAnarchs prefer a little bit more due process than that. At the very least, the \naccused is permitted to give his side of the story. Leaders are expected to invesirigate \nthe circumstances surrounding the alleged offense, and to report their findings to the \ncommunity. Some communities trust their leaders to determine guilt or innocence. \nOthers prefer a public trial. Punishment usually fits the crime, and some communities \nprefer banishment to destruction. Many anarchs believe penalties should be rehabili- \ntative rather than punitive. On the other hand, some idiots and malcontents just \nneed killing, and few object when a self-aggrandizing “revolutionary” who threatens \nto bring needless misery on anarchs everywhere is put down for the common good. \nCAMARILLAJUSTICE \nTo anarchs, there is no “justice” in the Camarilla, there’s “just us’’ against an old, \nentrenched, insane and power-mad “them.” The sect considers criminal those things \nto which anarchs feel entitled and the whole of Camarilla “justice” is geared toward \nkeeping things just the way they are. Worse, an innocent can be convicted of a so- \ncalled “crime” on nothing more than the word of a sufficiently influential elder, and \nwhat elder isn’t influential in the extreme compared to a neonate? \nIt’s bad enough knowing you can be put to Final Death on a whim, but the \nindignity hardly ends there. Other punishments exist that, while lenient in elder eyes, \nare infinitely worse to an anarch. One is being returned to your sire as an unreleased \nchilde (“Apparently, he failed to learn his lessons the first time; see that he does not \nfail again”). Another is being forced into blood slavery to the prince (“I trust, with your \nnewfound devotion to my safety, we have seen the last of your pathetic tantrum?“). \nAmong anarchs, the phrase “Camarilla justice” is an oxymoron. There can be no justice \nin the sect; its very existence is a crime against vampires everywhere. \nTHF SARRAT \nTechnically, the Sabbat is just a very large faction of the Anarch Movement. It is \nan astoundingly sick and twisted faction, of course, but it is still part of the drive to abolish \nelder rule. Ideologically, some strong similarities exist between the two: the commitment \nto destroy the Camarilla, the willingness to follow only those leaders who continually \nprove themselves, even to some extent the emphasis on combat proficiency and war \nparties. Some converts from the Sabbat have even gone so far as to describe unlife in an \nanarch gang as “Sabbat Lite” - \nall the camaraderie, none of the dogma. \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n89 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Superior in \nterms of raw ability, yes; even the lowliest of neonates soon manifest powers that are \ngodlike when compared to mortals.

As a general rule, mainstream anarchs treat mortals with \nrespect, if not as individuals then at least as a whole. To them, it is the ultimate \nhypocrisy to treat mortals in ways they refuse to accept from their own elders. \nPROMI~ES \nOF FREEDOM \nHappiness inslavery, the saying goes- and that’s exactly what the Sabbat gives. \nThe Vaulderie merely replaces a bond to one with a bond to many. Where, anarchs \nask, is the freedom in that? They hear the promises of freedom, but most know those \npromises are lies. It’s a tough sell for even the most silver-tongued of rogues, and the \nanarchs aren’t buying. Even most nihilists, who seldom retain much of their \nHumanity anyway, balk at the Vinculum. They know a leash when they see one. \nWAR AGAINST THE ANCIENTS \nSomewhere, somehow, the Sabbat went astray into religion and never came \nback. Few anarchs truly believe in the Antediluvians, and those who do simply aren’t \nconcerned about them. After all, if nuclear weapons haven’t roused them from \ntorpor, they must be down for the count.

Some prefer the Casanova way, others \nprefer the Sandman method. Some restrict themselves to animals, others are lucky \nenough to have a human herd. The difference is that unlike Camarilla loyalists, \nanarchs rarely have permission to feed whenever and wherever they get their meals, \nand this makes them poachers as far as the elders are concerned. Thus, the primary \nfeeding concern for most anarchs is knowing on which elder’s domain they are \npoaching, how to avoid being caught and just how that elder is likely to react when \n- \nand it’s a very frequent “when” - \nthey’re busted. \nMore often than not, elders extort some service from the offenders and let the \nmatter drop. Poaching is such a minor infraction that it’s just not worth the time lor the \ntrouble to make a big deal over a few pathetic upstarts sneaking a sip or three when they \nthought no one was looking. Occasionally, however, elders crack down hard, particu- \nlarly on repeat offenders. The last thing an elder can afford to do is look weak, because \nthat motivates his rivals to move on his assets. Sometimes, despite all precautioms, an \nanarch simply picks the wrong night to hunt in the wrong part of town. The next thing \nhe knows, he’s standing before the prince with a furious elder demanding his head. \nIncidents like this underscore the urgency of anarch demands for the equal \ndistribution of a city’s resources.

In this regard, anarchs find themselves made criminals \nby necessity whether they like it or not. \nTHEBLOOD \nBOND \nThere is more rampant hypocrisy throughout the Movement on this issue than \nperhaps on all others combined. No anarch wants to be enslaved to an elder; given \na choice, most would much rather die instead. The Bond is the one punishment that \nwill drive an otherwise rational anarch into the Sabbat. Many go, hoping and praying \nthey will be able to escape once the Bond is broken. Pitifully few ever return, and \nthose who do are never quite the same. Despite this, they go anyway, so strong is their \ndesire to be free. Without a doubt, anarchs see the Bond as one of the most heinous \ncrimes a vampire can commit - \nusually. \nThere are exceptions to every rule, and always people to make them when it suits \ntheir purposes. The default position of most anarchs is that the Bond is always wrong \nno matter who is Bound to whom for what reason, but more than a few find ar least \none reason to Bond someone for something.

Many of the same idealists \nwho decry “Blood Slavery” among vampires turn a blind eye toward the keeping of \nghouls, if only from sheer pragmatism - \nafter all, it’s hard to maintain ghouls without \nestablishing a bond, and they have to have s m e  way of keeping their many retainers \nloyal.

What follows is a brief study of their \norganization, leadership styles and some of the challenges facing their residents on \na night-to-night basis. \nORGANIZATION \nFNFMY \nTFRRITORY \nWhen the Camarilla, the Sabbat or another powerful entity dominates a metropo- \nlis, anarchs are usually few and far between. Organization is very loose or essentially \nnonexistent - \nother than hanging out together in their meager hunting grounds, they \ncan’t do very much without provoking their own destruction. Few anarchs wave the flag \nwith any vigor when overwhelmingly outnumbered, seeing no point in throwing their \nlives away when there’s little hope of lasting gain for the survivors. \nIn survival situations, continuing the struggle is all that matters. Anarchs who \nwillingly remain in such areas when they have the means to move elsewhere are \neither unmotivated posers or disciplined guerrillas. The posers tend to drop out of \nsociety altogether or go over to the other side when they get tired of existing on the \nragged edge. Guerrillas usually belong to covert terrorist and insurrection cells, \nsmuggling arms, allies and information under the enemy’s nose. Such revolutionaries \nare dedicated and highly dangerous to those in power. They do not hesitate to \neliminate anyone who threatens their operational security - \nincluding setting up \nother foolhardy or careless anarchs whose behavior threatens to expose their efforts \nto those in power. \nAnarchs in these territories tend to recognize no greater leader beyond those \nthey appoint to head up their own gangs or cells, and may not even stay in contact \nwith other local anarchs for fear of what might happen if one of their members is \ncaptured and tortured or mind-raped by the enemy. Much to the chagrin of Camarilla \nelders, rumors of a charismatic revolutionary leader in such territories are often \nnothing more than anarch propaganda designed to draw attention away from their \nmembers and cause foes to waste time chasing after a mythical enemy. \nDISPUTED \nTFRRITORIFS \nWhenneither the Camarilla nor the Sabbat completely dominates a metropolis, \nit logically follows that anarchs are both more numerous and more visibly active. \nWith greater numbers comes greater potential for change, and more often than not, \nlocal anarchs begin to defer to the most charismatic leader to make decisions for the \ngroup. Such leaders usually have a few trusted lieutenants whose loyalty is beyond \nquestion, and act as intermediaries between the anarchs and any other group with \nwhich the revolutionaries need to speak.

Full-fledged \ncouncils remain rare in disputed territories, however - \nfor better or worse, it is \ngenerally more useful to have one clear leader in times of conflict who can make quick \ndecisions than a dozen individuals of equal and possibly conflicting authority. \nTrouble occurs when more than one natural leader arises in a given area. Given \na choice, most anarchs follow leaders who best express their own beliefs, consciously \nrecognized or otherwise. If these personalties can co-exist or even work together, the \nresults can be impressive indeed; if they battle over methods or ideals, however, a \nbitter and explosive rivalry is sure to ensue. Sadly, potential troublemakers eager to \nplay a part in these violent tragedies are relatively common in anarch communities, \nnot to mention manipulative sect elders lurking in the wings trying to provoke such \ndramas at every opportunity. The same determination that gives a neonate the \nstrength to defy her elders and resist assimilation often makes her equally unwilling \nto compromise her ideals among her peers. To do so is to surrender her individual self \nand the principles around which she has based her unlife, and that’s just too much \nfor her to bear. \nThat said, it’s also a fact that anarch enclaves within disputed territories are still \nso small and comparatively weak that factional conflict very rarely escalates beyond \nconstant trash-talking, shouting matches and occasional brawls between hot-headed \nindividuals. Outright violence is frowned on by all sides, and inflicting Final Death \non a rival is almost certain to result in the immediate death of the offender and \ncensure of his entire gang as well.

Most anarch gangs are content to let their appointed leaders manage \nthe community as a whole while they deal with the issues of night-to-night existence. \nSo long as these leaders remember to lead by advice and example rather than nile by \ndictation and destruction, they retain their authority to mediate whatever disputes \ncan’t be resolved without their intervention. Leaders who let their authority go to \ntheir heads quickly lose the respect on which that authority is based, and tend tO lose \ntheir positions shortly afterward. \nCHAPIERTHREE \nTHE RIBEL UNLIFE \n91 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

While asingle baron \nmay represent a smaller community or be chosen to act as the proverbial “first among \nequals” for a representative body, given a chance anarchs generally prefer to govern their \nlarger communities via some form of council. Many of these councils begin as mere udhoc \nadvisory panels formed by the most civic-minded members of the community, but as the \ncommunity grows larger councilors find they require increasingly formal management in \norder to maintain harmony among the resident gangs and ensure that all anarchs feel their \nconcerns are being addressed properly. While the actual form a city’s council takes can \nbe whatever the community desires- -from a republic with councilors chosen by popular \nvote to a council of the most experienced anarchs in the city to something as arbitrary \nas representatives chosen by lottery- as a rule all councils have some means of including \nat least one member from each distinct gang or faction within the community (not each \nclan). Doing otherwise invites unrest and ill will from any faction slighted. \nNaturally, some radicals insist that any concentrationofpower is utterly unaccept- \nable. To these anarchists, power is rightfully vested only in the community as a whole. \nThey tolerate almost no formal government structure -when \na problem arises, they \nconvene popular assemblies wherein all interested citizens collectively decide how that \nproblem should be solved and act on it. While other anarchs respect their comrades’ \ndecisions in this respect, unfortunately the sects often find this structure relatively easy \nto exploit when attempting to conquer the territory; while it is harder to cripple the \nlocal anarchs by targeting specific individuals, it is also hard for the area’s revolution- \naries to coordinate strategy or reach any rapid decisions regarding imminent threats. \nRegardless of their particular structure, however, all Anarch Free Territories are \nremarkable for the level of liberty and privacy their citizens enjoy. So long as the \nresidents keep the Masquerade and avoid interfering in each other’s personal affairs, \nthey are generally free to come and go as they please, associate with whom they will, \nhunt as need dictates and sire as often as suits them. Not all of them last, for one \nreason or another, but the fact that they are possible makes the struggle worthwhile \nto anarchs everywhere.

In \ntheory, a Camarilla prince is an absolute authority unto himself within his domain; \nsimilarly, a Sabbat archbishop answers only to a cardinal and controls the local packs \nthrough orders passed down through subordinates. Anarch leaders, on the other \nhand, derive their authority solely from the consent of the communities in which \nthey reside. As a result, their power is often very broad but not especially forceful, \nbeyond whatever means they have of enforcing it themselves. Simply put: So long \nas the community respects her judgment, it will follow her lead. Should a leader lose \nher popularity, even someone as “lofty” as a baron, the community will ignore her. \nTHE ANARCH GIIDL \n98 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

In essence, the baron IS first \namong equals in the community. His fellow anarchs defer to him because they believe he \nis the best and brightest among them and therefore the least likely to lead them all to ruin. \nHe is responsible for keeping the peace between various anarch factions, which means \nin practice he spends most of his time handling dispute resolution. \nWhenever two anarchs (or two gangs) have a problem and they just can’t seem \nto work it out peacefully, it’s the baron who settles it for them the best way he can. \nThe problem in many communities is that by the time the baron steps in, it might \nalready be too late for a peaceful solution. When two or more gangs go to war with \neach other, the baron can often do little but throw up his hands and wait for the words \nor worse yet the bullets to stop flying. \nA baron’s power depends on his personal magnetism to a greater extent than any other \nanarch position. Given the wariness with which most anarchs regard a solitary figure in a \nposition of authority, a baron must tread carefully in order to ensure that his word carries \nreal weight with the local gangs, without appearing to go too far and be setting himself up \nas littlebetterthanapettytyrant.

If he \nis blessed with sufficient standing and charisma, he can make an unpopular decision ,stick. \nIf not, he’ll be ignored and the locals will find a new baron to follow. \nCOUNCILOR \nCommunities led by some form of council, whether it has a formal name or not, \ngenerally call those individuals councilors. In function, a councilor has many of the \nsame duties as a baron, especially regarding the pack or faction she represents; the \nonly difference is that she shares her authority with her fellow councilors. Councils \nare common in larger communities where the locals can’t agree on a single person to \nserve as baron, or where the locals don’t trust one person with total authority and seek \nan additional failsafe measure to prevent abuse. \nCouncils have slightly less trouble convincing their communities to accept and \nabide by unpopular decisions because they are viewed as less arbitrary and potentially \ntyrannical than a single baron. However, councils occasionally have trouble reach- \ning a decision in the first place. They often deadlock over controversial issues, and \nbickering between councilors occasionally results in one or more of them resigning \nfrom the council in disgust. Unless a community has the foresight to establish some \nbasic rules for fairly settling such disputes without intervention by a baron or other \noutside figure, a council can easily collapse under its own weight the first time one \ncouncilor tries to implement a plan or idea that another finds abhorrent. \nIt bears noting that councils almost never determine representative seating by clan \n-that, according to most anarchs, is reactionary baggage reminiscent of the Camarilla’s \nprimogen councils. Instead, they tend to seat councilors by peer group.

Such vampires are called deputies, sentinels or simply the militia. In order \nto combat allegations of corruption as well as the natural distrust that many anarchs \nhave for anyone with “official” authority to use force, most councils take care to ask \nfor deputies from each gang in order to ensure that everyone feels they are being \ntreated fairly. \nThose who infiltrate the enemy to gather intelligence are called Bonds or moles. \nNo matter how peaceful the community, it must always fear an attack from Camarilla \nor Sabbat forces intending to crush it and claim the city for themselves.

Accordingly, \nthe most common social unit among anarchs is the gang, which follows many parallels \nto modem urban gangs (though not quite as many as Camarilla elders claim). \nGangs serve two very important purposes. The most obvious is acting as a \ndeterrent against enemies threatening their members. Alone, the average anarch is \nrelatively easy prey, since he is young and often thin-blooded compared to his \ntraditional foes. However, potential assailants often think twice about attacking him \nif that means fighting a protracted and costly war with his entire gang. Eliminating \na single anarch is almost never worth the sudden firestorm of retaliatory violence that \ninvariably erupts. Accordingly, wearing gang colors or otherwise dressing to rleveal \nher association acts as a warning sign to everyone that no matter where an anarch \ngoes, she is never without allies. \nBeyond mere physical security lies a more important purpose. Simply put, \nexistence as a vampire is lonely, and anarch unlife can be lonelier still. In gangs, \nmembers find desperately needed comfort and reassurance in a very cold and tlrutal \nworld.

      "text": "STRUCTURE \nGangs differ primarily in structure, size and mobility. The structure of a gang \ndepends on its purpose. Almost by definition, gangs are quasi-military organizations, \nand collectively they are the closest thing to a standing army the Anarch Movement \nhas. In practice, however, they function as permanent independent militias. While \nthey readily cooperate to repel the occasional Sabbat crusade or, more rarely, an \narchon-led Camarilla task force, they spend most of their time fighting each other \nover ideological differences. Gangs that consider it evil to keep human servants no \nmatter what, for example, bitterly oppose gangs that rely on ghouls for extra muscle, \nand open conflict of one kind or another between such natural enemies is the norm. \nGang leaders have more authority over their followers and can, within reason, \nissue orders to their people with a reasonable expectation ofbeing obeyed. Surprisingly, \ndiscipline within the ranks is seldom a genuine problem, since any member who truly \nloses faith in her leaders may simply challenge them for command or call for a vote of \nconfidence. Together, these customs keep gang leaders relatively fair and honest. \nURBAN \nGANGS \nThe smallest gangs are little more than a single group of five to seven members, \nwith perhaps one or two members acting as the leader. Small gangs rarely control \nmore than a single neighborhood unless their members are unusually powerful \nindividually, or they maintain a veritable army of ghouls to bolster their battlefield \nstrength. Since a number of anarchs eschew using ghouls for ideological reasons, and \nmaintaining so many ghouls at the same time is such a tremendous strain, few gangs \nresort to this tactic unless in dire straits indeed. As aresult, small gangs either “squat” \non a larger gang’s turf (often paying tribute to do so) or ally with other gangs of similar \nsize to even the balance of power in an area. \nLarger gangs have seven to fifteen members usually subdivided into two or three \ngroups, called “sets.” Each set has a leader who functions as a lieutenant to the gang’s \noverall leader. These larger sets have the strength to control two or three neighbor- \nhoods in an area. Each set comprising the gang has a home neighborhood under its \ncontrol; the gang leader most often maintains his headquarters in the largest. Gangs of \nthis size form in one of two ways: Either a small gang gains a number of recruits in a \nrelatively short period of time, or a number of small gangs decide to merge into a single \nfamily, with each gang then becoming a set of the new gang. The latter event usually \noccurs when the component gangs of an alliance espouse the same or very similar \nbeliefs, but only one has a truly charismatic leader. Over time, that leader inadvertently \nattracts loyal followers of her own, further strengthening the gang as a whole. \nThe largest gangs have more than fifteen members subdivided into several sets. \nEach set controls a single home neighborhood. Each neighborhood is usually \nadjacent to another controlled by the same gang, or is of such strategic significance \nthat it is considered worthwhile to hold despite its relatively vulnerable position. \nCollectively, these neighborhoods comprise a single territorial claim that often \noccupies an entire city ward. The gang leader generally maintains a main headquar- \nters in the central or most easily defended area of this turf; his set leaders usually \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \nio2 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "maintain smaller “offices” in the neighborhoods they control. In exceedingly rare \ncases, a single gang can grow large enough to dominate an entire city and even claim \nturf in other cities nearby. In this case, the gang leader becomes a “general” with a \n“captain” who controls the turf in each city via his lieutenants in each set. The \ngeneral maintains a headquarters in the city his gang dominates with smaller \nheadquarters for eachcaptain in the satellite cities, and at least one set that routinely \ntravels between cities as a “courier” group. \nNOMADIC \nGANGS \nOne variation on the normal theme is the nomadic gang, similar in structure to \na“sett1ed” gang but different because it either lacks the strength to claim turf or, more \noften, simply prefers unlife on the open road. Nomadic gangs frequently pattern \nthemselves on mortal biker clubs rather than urban gangs, though for obvious reasons \nall but the most daring or reckless of such gangs always travel with trucks, vans and \nRVs in their caravans. Some have well-deserved reputations for raising hell, a fact \nthat often earns them a chilly reception from fellow anarchs who live under the \nwatchful eye of astern prince. Others keep alower profile, content to avoid notoriety \nwhile quietly spreading the word of revolution among vampires everywhere. Either \nway, they keep arms and information moving between cities. Without them, the \nMovement would be severely disadvantaged. \nIn practice, nomadic gangs recruit members, operate and divide authority in \nmuch the same way as other gangs, but with two pronounced changes: first, they tend \nto break into much smaller sets than settled gangs, if only to avoid the unwanted \nattention that a caravan of thirty or forty bikers or a dozen cars attracts even among \nthe local mortal population. Second, individual sets tend to have a corresponclingly \nlarger amount of freedom to do as they please given the amount of time they spend \napart from the whole. Most nomadic gangs hold periodic gathers where members \nshare stories, trade supplies and information or just enjoy each other’s company. \nGUERRILLA \nUNITSAND \nTERRORIST \nCELLS \nAnother variation on the normal theme is the guerrilla unit, identical in \nstructure to mortal “1iberationfronts”and “revolutionary armies” ifnot quite so large. \nUnlike nomadic or settled gangs, guerrilla units exist completely underground. An \naverage guerrilla unit operates alone or in small, independent cells. As a precaution, \neach member knows only her immediate superior in the chain of command and the \nother members of her cell. All communication between cells is done by coded \nmessages, Discipline use or similar arcane methods that are difficult to trace, let alone \ncrack or corrupt with bad information. In cities where multiple cells are active, each \nmust trust the unit’s central leadership for that city to keep them from unknowingly \ninterfering with each other’s activities. This pattern of secrecy repeats at each level \nof leadership. Even then, the central leadership almost always replaces the compro- \nmised cells before the enemy can act decisively on the information it has gained. \nGuerrilla units do not claim turf. When they can, they manage secret training \nfacilities far from the prying eyes of archons and templars, but are ready to abandon \nthese camps as quickly and efficiently as they can whenever they are discovered. \nCHAPTER \nTHEE: THE RIBEL UNLIR \n103 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Often, the first and only sign of their \npresence is a sudden overwhelming assault on the prince or archbishop and his \npersonal retinue of bodyguards. By the time the smoke clears and long before any \nreaction force can arrive, the guerrillas have incapacitated the bodyguards, killed or \ncaptured their target and disappeared into the night. This is the essence of uncon- \nventional warfare: to strike without warning, devastate the enemy in a single blow \nand then vanish, leaving him nothing tangible to target for retaliation. \nSecrecy is paramount among guerrilla units. Many reveal their existence only \nthrough pamphlets that define their agendas and justify their activities (often \ndropped at the scene of an action), and they guard the locations of their strongholds \nand the identities of their members with fanatical zeal. Despite the modern trappings \nof this form of revolution, their ranks can include the oldest and most powerful \nvampires in the Movement. Regardless of age, even newly recruited guerrillas quickly \nbecome wanted for a number of offenses that would result in their immediate \nexecution if they are ever captured and properly identified. Good cell leaders use this \nto their advantage, forging additional bonds of loyalty through shared criminal \nactivities or discouraging defection by ensuring that no one member would likely \nsurvive the justice of the enemy, even if he turned traitor willingly. Some guerrillas \nremain on the move, communicating through trusted intermediaries and avoiding \ncontact with anyone not known to them personally. Others hide in plain sight - \nhaving either permanently altered their appearances or eliminated any enemy who \ncan recognize them, they assume cover identities in the Camarilla or (rarely) the \nSabbat, biding their time until they can go active once again. \nGFTTING \nIN \nThe process of joining a gang is fairly standard regardless of the type of gang a \nparticularanarchjoins. It is asimpleprocess, buthardly aneasy one. It almostgoeswithout \nsaying that a vampire can’t just walk up to a gang member and ask to join his gang - \nthat \napproach gets her nowhere. At best, the member laughs in her face and then ignores her. \nAt worst, he strings her along with promises of membership and then hangs her out to dry \nafter getting her into serious trouble, possibly even leaving her to take the fall for one of \nthe gang’s actions. If an anarch really wants to join agang, he must first demonstrate that \nhe is committed to the Anarch Movement in general and the gang’s agenda in particular. \nOnce he does this, the gang he wants to join generally comes to him with aseries of formal \nor informal tests that must be completed before the gang considers granting even partial \nmembership. It may take months, years or even decades depending on the size and secrecy \nlevel of the gang, but if he’s truly down, the wait doesn’t bother him. Remember that \nvampires think in the long term, especially older ones -while a common street gang may \nnot be able to afford to wait adecade to get anew member when there’s a war on the streets \nright now, an elite guerrilla cell might find that wait perfectly reasonable. \nWhile individual trials vary widely from gang to gang, there are some constants. \nUrban gangs tend to require new members to commit a series of crimes, or possibly \ngive a prospective recruit a goal (such as raise a certain amount of money) and judge \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n104 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Naturally, \nwhether he is supposed to hold his own in such situations or simply take the \npunishment stoically depends on the gang and the member in question. \nPRO~PECT \nEventually, if he passes the tests and makes the right impression on the right people, \na gang member approaches him and asks a final round of often highly loaded questions \nto determine his sincerity. If he gives the right answers (not an easy task), he becomes a \n“prospect.” From that point forward, he must hang with the set that controls his \nneighborhood, make an honest effort to acquaint himself with every member of the gang \n- \nmany of whom will feign complete disinterest or even outright hostility -- and \nparticipate in various missions against the gang’s enemies.

During this time, his sponsor \nprovides basic instruction about the gang’s structure, history, customs, ideology, \nmethodology and territory. If necessary, she provides similar instruction about the \nAnarch Movement in general. This training, called “indoctrination,” is necessary to \nimpart the proper attitude about the gang, their operations, their enemies and unlife \nin general.

If he maintains \nhis intent to join, the gang leader administers a loyalty oath. After taking the oath, \nhe accepts his colors from his justifiably proud sponsor. \nBecause of their independent-cell structure, guerrilla units maintain far more \nsecrecy regarding their members.

If at least one participant wins the test, the \nprevailing seers experience a vision with a level of detail equivalent to a ten-Trait \nvoluntary Insight success. \nInsight Shock \nIt’s possible to see too much through group Insight.

The cost and effects of the Thin Blood Flaw are already \nfigured into the cost of the Fifteenth Generation Flaw, though take care to read its \nwording precisely, as it differs slightly from the standard Thin Blood Flaw. \nFourteenth Generation (2-Trait Physical Flaw) \nYou were sired just a few years ago by a member of the thirteenth generation. \nAlthough your Blood Pool is the same as that of a thirteenth-generation vampire, you \ncan use only eight of your Blood Traits to heal wounds, raise Physical Attributes or \nfuel Disciplines that require vitae. You can still use the remaining two Blood Traits \nnormally for other purposes, including rising each night, creating and sustaining \nghouls, creating progeny and creating Blood Bonds, though your attempts to bond \nanother do not always succeed, at the Storyteller’s discretion.

You can use your remaining four Blood Traits to survive through \nthe day and rise each night, but nothing more. You cannot sire progeny, nor can your \nblood create ghouls or a blood bond, although it is possible for you to have children in \nthe normal fashion (albeit very rarely). Sunlight inflicts only lethal damage on you, \ninstead of aggravated damage as it does to other vampires. You can consume normal \nfood and drink and hold it down for about an hour or so before vomiting it up. \nThin Blood (4-Trait Physical Flaw) \nYou are one of the growing number of thin-blooded vampires whose cominx was \nforetold in the Book of Nod. The Curse of Caine is weak in you: while you suffer all the \nill effects of your vampiric condition, you do not receive all its benefits. You may expend \nBlood Traits to heal wounds, fuel Disciplines or raise your Physical Attributes, but all \ncosts for these actions are doubled. Your vitae is so weak that it cannot create blood \nbonds, nor can it create or sustain ghouls. Should you attempt to create progeny, the \nEmbrace has little chance of succeeding.

You still age, albeit very slowly \n-perhaps one mortal year for every 20 calendar years you survive. The effects of this \nFlaw are not readily noticeable to you or others, but eventually you will grow old and \ndie, though not likely before you have suffered considerably from your decrepitude. \nSometimes, however, your aging process accelerates: like aghoul deprived ofvitae, your \ndeferred aging can return suddenly. Whenever you heal a Health Level of aggravated \ndamage, you age an entire year in the course of a single day’s sleep. This may not seem \nlike much of an inconvenience, but the effects can add up fast if your unlife is plagued \nby frequent exposure to sunlight or other sources of aggravated damage, and eventually \nyour immortality will become a wizened thing indeed. \nHemetic (4-Trait Mental Flaw) \nYou find the very idea of drinking blood repulsive: in fact, just thinking about \nit makes you physically ill, an inconvenient problem for a vampire. In order to hold \nthe vitae you consume within your system until you absorb it, you must make a Static \nPhysical Challenge against six Traits immediately after feeding.

This Flaw can prove misleading to those vampires who \nbelieve that evidence of a clan weakness can pinpoint the Caitiffs ancestry: some \nCaitiff spontaneously replicate a clan weakness, with no connection to its lineage. \nDecrepitude (3-Trait Supernatural Flaw) \nWhen you suffer aggravated damage, the Curse of Caine doesn’t always succeed \nat repairing the injuries.

Predictably, some anarchs desire \nonly to exploit this valuable new resource. Others, particularly the more studiously \ninclined, see the dhampirs as proof that the Final Nights have not only arrived but \nhave parked their cycles at the curb.

Unable to share in \nthe rewards of unlife because they were Embraced in the wrong century or into the \nwrong lineage, permanently frustrated in their ambitions by an immovable socio- \npolitical barrier, the fledgling anarchs understand that the Ivory Tower is little more \nthan a decaying shell. It must be pulled down so that a better structure can be built \natop its smoking ruins. Unfortunately for the Anarch Movement, this attitude is \nexactly what the Camarilla expects from the anarchs, and it generally gives even the \nmore moderate members of the Cause a bad name. \nThe prevailing stereotype claims that all younger anarchs gravitate toward \nviolence as an expression of their passions, and that many if not all are so frustrated \nby their situation that they simply aren’t willing to stop punching things long enough \nto listen to or consider other alternatives. This stereotype isn’t without its merits: \npassion and frustration often lead to action, and that action is frequently direct and \nviolent. The problem is compounded by the fact that a goodly number of younger \nanarchs are just that: young, both in terms of mortality and unlife. Mortals who \nexpect youth not to rebel are fooling themselves, and the same can be said in many \ncases among the Kindred. \nEmbraced recently enough to recall the intimate details of their breathing days, \nmany young anarchs developed something of a “vending machine mentality” when \nthey were alive: quarter goes in, candy comes out. Young mortals often expect their \nwishes and needs to be gratified instantly: imagine the rude shock they encounter \nwhen, after being Embraced, they discover a shadow society they never knew existed \nin which their wishes and needs automatically take a backseat to those of the Kindred \nin power. Is it any wonder that mortals raised on the milk of democratic rhetoric and \ntaught that their ancestors fought wars to gain the right to self-determination will \nrankle, possibly even start breaking things, when they are forced into subservient \nroles by virtue of what seems an arbitrary set of factors? Unfortunately, most elders \nand even the ancillae have forgotten what it was to be a young mortal, and cannot \nidentify with their progeny on these points. They tend to react harshly to the \nobjections of the young, and this breeds even more resentment in those who could \nideally benefit from the wisdom of their sires. \nHow will you reflect this revolutionary zeal in your portrayal of your character, \nparticularly if you’re playing in a Masquerade game that’s focused on one of the two \nlarger sects?

Don’t be surprised if the agitators accuse you \nof selling out and brand you as one of the Kindred whom they believe they are struggling \nagainst: they’ll come around eventually, if they live that long. \nProbably the greatest danger to your continued affiliation with the Anarch \nMovement is your long exposure to the Camarilla. Think about this: if you’ve \nsurvived as a committed anarch for more than a few decades, you’ve doubtless seen \nthe way that the Camarilla Kindred live their unlives up close and personal. It’s \npossible that, after so many nights of struggle, you might begin to feel a bit envious \nof their comforts and privileges. And should you actually manage to gain even a small \namount of status or power within the Ivory Tower, you’ll inevitably suffer ternpta- \ntions, and not just the ones you might expect. Indeed, once you comprehend exactly \nwhat the elders have been trying to withhold from you and your fellow agitators, you \nmight have a decidedly difficult time giving it up. And that, of course, will lead to \npangs of conscience, and possibly even a backlash from other anarchs who rnight \nview your inner turmoil as a betrayal of all they hold sacred. If you’re lucky, lrou’ll \nstave off these temptations and carry on with your lofty goals; if not, you’ll probably \nend up becoming exactly what you once despised.. . and that’s fun to roleplay! \nCHAPTTR \nFOUR: RADKAL THINKJNG \n125 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Maybe you’ve always been something of \na reformer, using your time and energy to create a better world, or at least to oppose \ngroups and individuals that seem intent on garnering power and money .at the \nexpense of others. Some anarchs doubtless choose their progeny from the ranks of \nmortal reformist and dissident groups, and the last four decades have been marked \nwith numerous worthy causes in which your character might have been involved. \nMaybe you marched and practiced civil disobedience for civil rights in the 1960s, or \ntook to the streets to protest economic globalization in the 1990s. You mighi: have \nbeen a campus radical or anti-war demonstrator in the turbulent 1970s, or an \nenvironmental activist in the industrial madhouse of the 1980s. Connection.i with \nany of these might be reflected during play through your attire, language or behavior. \nWhen you’re comfortable with the circumstances of your mortal background, \nmove on to the post-Embrace events of your unlife. At some point, you lost your belief \nin the validity of the sects (if you ever had any). When and why did this happen? Try \nto pinpoint exactly what it is about this rotting shell of the vampires’ socio-political \nstructure that makes your character so angry or resentful. The reality of such one- \nsided partisan politics stirs something in the heart, mind and gut of the anarch. \nPerhaps your character was Embraced into circumstances that brought these lessons \nhome fast and hard early in her existence among the Kindred - \nthis happens most \nfrequently to Caitiff, Malkavians, Nosferatu and other “outsider” clans and tdood- \nlines who find themselves holding the short end of the Camarilla’s social stick. \nIt can also occur with characters of more “acceptable” lineage, such as the \nToreador, Tremere and Ventrue: anyone who feels alienated and frustrated tiy the \nartificial limitations of her society can experience the desire to restructure her \nenvironment more favorably. Perhaps the prince didn’t even bother with a token \nattempt to disguise his pro-elder favoritism and blatant cronyism, and this rankled \nyour sensibilities to the point where you got fed up and started thinking aboui: how \nto change things for the better.

Many Kindred will expect you to stride intcr, the \nElysium waving a placard that reads “Social Justice Now!” And maybe that’s exactly \nwhat you had in mind, since a little agitprop sometimes gets the attention of irhose \nwho might be interested in your cause. But it also confirms all of the Kindred’s worst \nsuspicions about you, and by extension all other anarchs. If this is the way you wish \nto go, be prepared not only for the stinging lash of the harpy’s tongue, but to let such \ntaunts and insults slide without visible effect -starting a fight in Elysium is a quick \nticket out of the city, and never forget most Camarilla members are just waiting for \nCHAPIER FOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n127 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Are there any identifiable clothing \ntrends from the period of your Embrace that you can use to help personalize your \ncharacter? The best sources of inexpensive costume pieces are your local vintage \nclothing and secondhand stores. Were you a flower child or a disco king in your \nbreathing days? You needn’t spend a fortune recreating a vintage 1960s wardrobe: \njust a few items, such as a colorful flower-print skirt and a beaded headband, are \nsufficient to give the sense of the time and place. Green hair and a denim jacket \ndecorated with a few well-chosen buttons could suggest the punk streets of London \nin the 1980s, while a flannel shirt and Doc Martens conjure up the grunge look of the \nearly 1990s. When in doubt, go to the library or online and look up fashions for the \ndesired time period. \nAlso think about how you want to be perceived, what missions you may be \nundertaking from night to night, and how these factors might affect your sartorial \nstyle. Will you be rousing the rabble when you’re not flinging Molotov cocktails at \nthe prince’s haven? You’ll want durable but flashy clothes and thick-soled boots for \nextra height, maybe a bold hair color and couple of tattoos that symbolize your anger \ntoward the status quo.

The final step is to consider how your character will spend her \nnights, and that means thinking about the different ways in which she’ll interact not \nonly with the story but the other characters as well. Your character wants to \nencourage change, promote equality and redistribute power.. . but how? \nIf you’re playing in an all-anarch chronicle, your character won’t lack for \nmissions and other assigned activities. But in chronicles that focus mainly on the \nSabbat or the Camarilla, you’ll want to make sure that in addition to the other \nmotivations discussed in this chapter, your character also has a mission in her unlife. \nThe best missions are longdterm assignments that your character can undertake \ncontinuously as part of her night-to-night existence: these afford you the best \nroleplaying opportunities because they support your character’s continuous develop- \nment throughout the story. But one-shot and short-term missions can also be fun and \nadd spice to the game. A few of both types of assignments appear below. \nSetting Up Shop \nWhen anarchs roll into a new city, somebody has to have a look around. Scouting \nout the lay of the land is usually a prelude to determining whether or not the local \nauthority figures are currently greeting anarchs with open arms, loaded firearms or a \nreception somewhere in between these extremes. It’s usually wise to send one, two or \neven three anarchs into a city to check the situation, or maybe even to make ccntact \nwith a cell if one is known to exist. If your character is assigned the “take a peek” task, \nremember that while you and yours may call what you’re doing “scouting,” the local \nKindred or Cainites might call it “spying.” While the two activities are largely one and \nthe same, being accused and found guilty of the latter can carry consequences many \ntimes more unpleasant than the former. To be clear: failing to mention that you’re a \nmember of the Anarch Movement when you present yourself to the prince can and will \ncome back to haunt you. On the other hand, admitting your political affiliation openly \nwhen you first hit town can be equally disastrous, so it’s probably best to keep this under \nyour hat until you see which way the wind is blowing (which is what you’re supDosed \nto be doing in the first place, right?). \nShould you want to elicit the attention of potential recruits, you need to make \nyour presence known. If you’re fortunate enough to be enjoying the company of a \nnumber of fellow anarchs- preferably a large number -you might be able to simply \nwalk into the Elysium or other local Kindred hangout and say hello. If your group is \nsufficiently numerous, the Sheriff and her deputies probably can’t respond effect ively \nin short order, giving you time to have a look around. Of course, if you’ve chosen to \nenter the Elysium on your scouting mission, you can probably expect to be free from \noutright violence as long as you observe the same courtesy. Remember, the purpose \nof the scouting mission isn’t to wreak havoc or fire up the neonates, but to take a look \nat what you’re up against and make your presence known. Once they know you’re in \ntown, curious neonates and disgruntled Kindred will eventually seek you out if they \nare interested in hearing your pitch. \nIf you’re fortunate, the elders will do some of your recruiting for you.

If nobody knows about the Cause, nobody’s going to join up, right? \nSo somebody must seek out and interact with potential recruits. \nSome anarchs never miss an opportunity to turn each conversation around to \nthe topic of the desperate need for greater equality among Cainites, and what the \nanarchs are doing to achieve it, regardless of the social situation or company. They \nreason that if they talk up the Cause often enough, eventually their words will fall \non the right ears. The drawbacks of this approach include being dismissed as a broken \nrecord and, more importantly, attracting the attention of authority figures who won’t \ntake kindly to your “subversive” dialogue. Other anarch characters, usually among \nthe youngest or most frustrated of their ilk, seekout gatherings of Kindred or Cainites \nand deliberately set about trying to instigate immediate and radical change by \nexhorting their fellows to rise up on the spot. \nIn ideal circumstances, your character would keep a low profile when proselytizing, \nmaybe hanging out in the parts of town usually frequented by younger Licks, in order to \nminimize the chances of getting caught. If you’re playing in a chronicle that permits your \ncharacter to engage in activities during the downtime between game sessions, there’s no \nreason your character can’t do exactly that. Your Storyteller will determine whether or \nnot you encounter any other vampires and the result of your interactions with them. \nIf you’re the type of firebrand who finds satisfaction in sounding the clarion call to \naction, you’ll probably find yourself with lots of opportunities to do that every time you \nset foot in a Kindred gathering. Chances are you won’t have to wait more than ten or \nfifteen minutes for an example of exactly why the time for political discourse is ended to \npresent itself. Whether it’s the prince calling for the primogen to assemble for yet another \nround of pointless bickering, or the announcement of yet more grants of status to the \nharpy’s supporters, it’s revolting and all one to you.

Presence is the indispensable Discipline for ambassadors, though a little \nDominate to get past the low-end obstacles or some Auspex to watch the moods of \nthose you’re dealing with aren’t bad either. \nOut Come the Wolves \nSome anarch character concepts are built around the use of force as the most \neffective method of changing the status quo. You’ve already been warned aboui: what \nhappens to those who live by the sword, but if you’re determined to paint a target on \nyour head, that’s up to you. So what are the practicalities of taking away an asset of \nthe enemy and making it yours? \nFirst, do your homework. What or who is the target? Will you undertake the raid \nduring a game session or in the downtime? What tools or resources do you need ’Who \nowns what you’re trying to take or damage? How is it likely to be protected? \nUnplanned smash-and-grab missions rarely succeed, and the handful that do almost \nalways lead to vicious repercussions later. The same goes for burning down a haven, \ndestroying property owned by elders and hurting or killing ghouls who serve the \nKindred. All these activities are types of raids, and they should be undertaken only \nafter you’ve scoped out the enemy. You don’t want to pull into the parking garage \nwhere you planned to kick the stuffing out of a few ghouls who work for the Ventrue \nprimogen, only to find a meeting of the local chapter of the Big Bad Sabbat Pack. \nConsider less obvious targets. If security at the prince’s downtown office building \nis simply too tight, maybe the influences of his newest childe are more vulnerable. \nMaybe you can’t get into the Nosferatu-controlled sewers, but you can probably \nlocate and harass the homeless bums that keep the Sewer Rats abreast of news on the \nstreet. Use face-to-face interactions with other characters to ferret out the nature and \ntypes of their holdings. Don’t be afraid to make deals with other characters to gain \nthis kind of information: whether or not you honor your boons could go a long way \ntoward establishing your credibility with potential sources of useful dirt and gossip. \nNext, have a plan and stick to it. Know who is going to accomplish what task, \nand try to have some kind of contingency plan in case things go wrong. Work out your \nescape route in advance, maybe arranging for some diversionary tactics. Make the \nmost of your supernatural assets: review the Disciplines and Abilities available to you \nand identify those that can help you get the job done and then get out again. \nFinally, understand and accept that, with rare exceptions, the typical raid only \ninconveniences the target. Actually gaining possession of the target of your raid \nshould be only one of several goals. Raids (including unsuccessful ones) make noise \nand call attention to your cause. Be sure potential recruits hear about the raid, even \nif it’s too risky to cop to it personally. Raids also make great diversions.

These help you check out \npotential targets and conceal your activities from the watchful eyes of the elders.

Ask your contacts what’s been \nshaking lately among the city’s criminal element before you decide to whack that \nstreet dealer who’s one of the deputy’s little smack peddlers. Bureaucracy, Empathy \nand Investigation are helpful in wheedling useful information out of Kindred and kine, \nas are Auspex, Dominate and Presence powers. \nObviously the raiders themselves should be equipped to handle trouble: Make \nsure they’re well-stocked with Physical, Blood and Willpower Traits before they \nstrike. Every Discipline and power has its place in raiding: Obfuscate, Quietus and \nObtenebration can hide raiders as they’re getting in and out of the target location. \nNaturally, Celerity, Fortitude, Potence and Protean, backed up with Brawl, Melee, \nFirearms and Security Abilities, can make the difference between getting out alive \nand not getting out at all. \nShaken, Not Stirred \nSo you’re playing a Bond, huh?

However, \nunless you want to risk blowing your cover, all your efforts to make a difference on \nbehalf of the anarchs should be subtle.

The chameleon offers a lot of solid roleplaying \nopportunities for anarch characters, particularly those who intend to be around long \nenough to (hopefully) see their labors bear fruit. Your character might also do it for \nthe sheer thrill - \nafter all, what could be more exciting than subverting the system \nfrom within by hiding right under your enemy’s nose? Knowing that you’re putting \none over on the enemy can be a tremendous rush. Or maybe you’re convinced that \nonly by becoming a mole and working to better the anarchs’ lot from within the \nCamarilla can you accomplish something important. \nRegardless of your motivation, remember to be clear about your role: You’re a full- \nfledged and committed member of the Anarch Movement who is willing to jeopardize \nyour reputation, holdings and safety to further the aims of the Cause. Your assignment \nis to convince everyone that you are a respected and respectable member of the status \nquo, preferably gaining a place within the very power structure that you’re trying to \nalter.

Stocking up on \nWillpower is almost never a bad idea, both to keep your Traits up and help resist the \npowers that fly in the social setting in which you’ll be immersed. Needless to say, \nPresence and Dominate are both valuable for helping win over allies and fix slips in \nyour cover, while Obfuscate and Obtenebration are vital for situations requiring \ngenuine stealth.

      "text": "GAMES \nANARCHISTS \nPLAY \nUnless you’re playing in an all-anarch chronicle, do not attempt to engage in any \nfavorite anarch amusements where the Kindred can observe you. If you have to ask \nwhy you shouldn’t play a game of “Nines” in the vacant lot behind the art museum \nwhile the elders are enjoying the pleasures of the Elysium, we can only advise you to \nhave your next character firmly in mind and ready to play. But when you’re hanging \nwith your revolutionary buddies, it’s sometimes fun to cut loose and enjoy a few hours \nof respite from the grim and deadly world of undead political activism. \nBear Baiting - \nA time-honored pastime among anarchs young and old, this is \none of the few games anarchs play in full view of other Kindred. In fact, it’s played \nin the Elysium. The rules are simple: Without violating the letter of the law in \nElysium, an anarch tries to goad, taunt or debate an elder into an embarrassing \noutburst (or frenzy, if the anarch thinks he can take the pounding). Needless to say, \nthis kind of recreation is incredibly dangerous, and can have repercussions that reach \nfar beyond the immediate problem of making an enemy out of the target elder. \nLA. Rouktte - \nTwo anarchs stand facing one another and smash each other \nwith a baseball bat, police baton, section of rebar or their fists until one of them gives \nup or falls into torpor. Although proponents of L.A. Roulette insist that it’s a kind \nof modern duel of honor, many dismiss it as a waste of time and good baseball bats. \nPin the Tail on the Prince -Exactly what it sounds like, this variation on the mortal \nchild’s party game features a prince rather than a donkey. Or rather it features an \nunfortunate anarch who represents the prince (some go so far as to dress him in clothes \nthat mimic the local praxis holder). In this version of the game, the target is blindfolded \nand tries to escape the players, all of whom are attempting to attach a prop tail to his \nperson, usually with a suitably sharp object such as a hunting knife or railroad spike. \nObviously, this game often results in hurt feelings among those who play it. \nNines - \nThis pastime is suitable for play in deserted quarries, abandoned \nfactories and just about any other place distant from the heart of the city. The game \nis similar to paintball, except that its players use real firearms with live ammunition. \nThe exact rules vary from place to place, with the only common denominator being \n“no deliberate head shots.” Smart anarchs place lookouts nearby to warn them of \napproaching cops, innocent bystanders and furious sheriffs. A more deadly variation \nof this game, “Sixty-Nines,” pits the anarchs against a target or targets who are \nunaware they are playing a game. Final Death is rarely incurred during such games, \nat least for the anarchs, though serious injuries are understandably fairly common. \nShould the targets manage to fight their way out, the anarchs let them in on the \n“joke” and go off on their merry way, leaving their shattered and bewildered dupes \nto wonder exactly what happened to them. \nNote: Be mindful of the cardinal rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre. They always \napply, even if your character is participating in a high-speed game of neonate tag \nthrough a crowded park. Fun as they may be when handled correctly, some of these \ngames may be inappropriate for certain players, troupes or even venues, so use \ncommon sense and consult the Storyteller when in doubt about whether or not a \nparticular game is appropriate. \ne\ni\nTHL ANARCH \nGUIDE \n138 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

You might not be able to give them everything they want -you have a number \nof other players and the integrity of your Chronicle’s story to consider, after all -but \nyou should at least make an effort to launch anarch-related stories in the right direction. \nAre the players hoping for a tense “Cold War” scenario in which they play cat and \nmouse against the prince and primogen through the halls of Elysium? Or maybe a \nnightly running fight for survival against the unrelenting scourge? How about a fast- \npaced action adventure yarn that pits them against a ductus and her loyal packmates? \nTalk to your anarch players before they create their characters: It’s best to figure \nout what your players’ preferences are before their characters actually enter play. This \nis particularly important when incorporating anarchs into your existing Chronicle. \nPreparing a coterie of armed revolutionaries dedicated to the violent overthrow of \nthe Camarilla and then dropping them into your subtle Elysium-based game of \npolitical intrigue is a sure ticket to catastrophe.

Chronicles built around the \nCamarilla can often sustain a sizable number of anarch characters, since the Ivory \nTower is the traditional antagonist in stories featuring anarchs yet does not always have \na kill-on-sight order for them either. Many anarchs operate routinely (if not conifort- \nably) within the Camarilla, working toward changing its hidebound attitude; and \noppressive social structure, and the Camarilla Kindred often tolerate these inconve- \nnient residents. Depending on how openly rebellious the anarch characters are, a good \nrule of thumb is one anarch character for every five Kindred. This number may grow \nas the anarchs recruit disgruntled neonates to their cause, or shrink as the elders work \ndirectly against the revolutionaries, but it provides a working baseline. If your \nCamarilla story focuses on social and political intrigue, count on the anarchs’ numbers \nto shrink rapidly if they show signs of making open war on the Kindred and their assets. \nIn stories centered on the Sabbat, scale is often the deciding factor in determin- \ning how long the anarch characters will survive.

Scale can get tricky in these stories, \nbecause the anarchs have little choice other than to violently oppose the Sabbat if \nthey hope to stay alive. The right number of anarchs for Sabbat-centric stories varies \ndepending on the style of the Chronicle. If the story includes a significant amount \nof political intrigue between rival powers, you could probably start with the same \nratio as for Camarilla-centric stories (51). But in general, entire cities dominated by \nthe Sword of Caine can support a small number of experienced and tough, or a larger \nnumber of desperate or clever, anarch characters. Suppose you’re telling the story of \ntwo rival Sabbat packs engaged in a street-level battle against the local Camarilla: \nHow many anarch characters could you safely drop into the middle of this conflict? \nToo few and the Sabbat will simply destroy them out of hand: too many and they’ll \nlikely change the entire nature of the Chronicle. You want enough anarchs to present \nthe rival packs with options other than destroying the anarchs right away, but not so \nmany that the Sabbat flee the city because they suddenly feel outnumbered. \nFor all-anarch Chronicles, scale takes on a completely different meaning.

But you’ll need to take into consideration how many \nmembers of the various factions within the Anarch Movement you’re going to \ninclude.

Violence is not \nuncommon in revolutionary plots, as the more radical anarchs support organized \ncampaigns against the Camarilla in the hope of displacing the Ivory Tower’s grip on \nlocal resources. This kind of grass-roots activism works best, again, if the anarchs are \nNarrator characters - \nnot because the anarchs in these plots are necessarily antago- \nnists, but because you want to be certain that the revolutionaries don’t try to wantonly \ndestroy everyone who opposes them. To present the anarchs as a credible threat and \ngive them a decent chance of survival in the early days of the plot, consider arranging \nfor the radicals to hole up in a location that’s well suited to their agenda, such as a college \ncampus or union-controlled factory. There the characters can gain access to resources, \nincluding mortal followers, which can support and prolong their cause without \nstraining the story’s credibility from the beginning. \nJustice for All: Social Reform Plots \nPerhaps the most common source of the dissatisfaction and desperation that leads to \nthe creation of anarchs is the social environment in which they are expected to survive. The \nCamarilla relies on a neo-feudal social structure to keep the princes (and, more importantly, \nthe elders) at the top of the heap. Understandably, this is stultifying to Kindred who just a \nfew short years ago were enjoying the unprecedented social and personal freedoms of the \n21st century, and many of them find that they simply can’t or won’t put up with that kind \nof crap. It’s bad enough that they’ve been turned into unliving, blood-drding monsters, \nbut they’ve also got to smile and lick the boots of even more terrible monsters? The cliche \n“anarchs screaming at theprince”scenari0 is what most often comes to mind when thinking \nabout social advancement. But a Chronicle built around social and cultural conflicts can \nbe a rich roleplaying environment for your players. \nAnarchs are much closer to their mortal roots than most elders and ancillae, so \nthey’re capable of keeping up with current mortal trends and fashions. Maybe the \nanarch characters open their own club, gallery or rave, making it more appealing than \nwhat the Kindred can make available by tapping into popular counter-culture music, \nlanguage, fashions and dkcor. Suddenly the established Kindred aren’t the trendsetters \namong the mortal population of the city: That distinction goes now to the anarchs. \nStatus seekers among the Kindred must either submit to the anarchs’ superiority in \nthe social arena or compete with them. Which do you think they’re going to do? \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \nI46 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "-+ \ni \nC \nFrom here the story might branch in several different directions. The Kindred \ncould try to move directly against the source of their embarrassment by attacking \nproperties and even people with which the anarchs are associated: The same is true \nfor the anarchs. The Kindred could attempt to fight back using their accumulated \nconnections to the mortal world, such as their Influences, forcing the anarchs to \nexpend their (probably much less extensive) resources to block the Kindred’s \ngambits. The anarchs may find themselves waging a guerrilla war without guns in \norder to hold on to what they’ve got, scrambling to stay ahead of the trend curve by \nscouting continuously for new acts and supporting their own avenues of success. Or \nthey might resort to violence out of frustration: Turning the Malkavian whip’s latest \nrave into a free-for-all bar brawl could certainly generate some negative press. \nIt’s important to remember that stories of this stripe are intended to be about \nanarchs, not about neonates who just want to appropriate the goodies that belong to \ntheir elders, or who like to hang out and jam to heavy metal music together. Anarchs \nhave concerns that are tied to the emerging social scene, and that includes the black \nmarket for firearms, the illicit drug trade and peddling political influence. Angry \nneonates leaping for the brass ring aren’t necessarily anarchs, and vice versa. \nShare the Wealth: Economic Advancement Plots \nSome anarchs claim to be above the needs of filthy lucre, but not all of them share \nthis sentiment. And is it really so surprising that anarchs might want to have their crack \nat enjoying the financial benefits of unlife? Eonomic reform plots in your Chronicle \nmight focus on anarchs who start up their own companies, maybe in the high-tech or \ntechnical communications fields. The key here is to give the anarchs a chance to compete \nin new ways with the elders’ more traditional business interests. Is your Chronicle set in \nan area that’s dominated by a single industry? If so, chances are that some of the most \npowerful and influential characters in your game have ties to that industry. If the anarch \ncharacters can identify these holdings, they can attack them, directly or indirectly. Or the \nanarchs could try to muscle in on the more mundane businesses controlled by the \nKindred, such as clothing boutiques, art galleries and trendy nightclubs. Who knows - \nwith the mistakes of the past behind them, the anarch-run companies might prove \nsuccessful where the over-hyped firms of the 1990s failed. \nNo Justice, No Peace: Combat Plots \nIt’s sometimes true that players choose anarchs because they want to beat on \nthings until they break. If this is what your players really want, you have a \nresponsibility to give it to them, so long as it doesn’t do the Chronicle as a whole a \ngrave disservice. But running combat plots doesn’t mean every game must be a tllood- \ndrenched, all-out melee to the death (or hours spent in tests and combat time). With \na little preparation, you can turn a combat plot into a memorable and challenging \nroleplaying experience for your players. \nRather than throwing a bunch of random enemies at your players - \nthe scourge \nthis week, shovelhead packs the next, etc. -plan out the individual battles so that \nthe participants, objectives and stakes are clear for both sides. Where do the anarchs \nthink they’re going to run into trouble? Maybe they’re planning a raid on a factory \nowned by the seneschal, intending to damage his ability to generate cash flow.

If your players balk \nat doing “busy work” because they just want to get down to throwingpunches, remind \nthem that battles are usually very fast, confusing encounters, and that victory \ngenerally goes to the side that did its homework on the enemy. \nThe same holds true when antagonists come to call. Contrary to the belief of \ncertain players, most vampires and other Supernatural creatures do not automatically \nfight to the death: Life and unlife are too precious to throw away merely to prove a point. \nThe enemy should have objectives -drive off the invaders, kill an important fgure, \nrescue a hostage, capture a prisoner, etc. - \nand tactics that support them. An enemy \ntrying to retake his lost turf fights differently than the foe whose main goal is to provide \na diversion for the real assault that is coming later. It is also a common mistake that \nmany enemies (supernatural and otherwise) fail to use anything but the most obvious \nand direct means of attacking their foes, in contrast to the nuanced Discipline use and \npainstaking mundane preparations employed by the players. Most often this happens \nwhen Storytellers make up enemies on the fly and don’t give them any thought beyond \nthe immediate conflict. Your enemies often have access to supernatural powers and \nresources too - \nmake sure they use them to their full advantage! \nThe key to running good combat plots is to make the antagonists believable. \nDon’t just throw wave after wave of faceless deputies or anonymous Sabbat packs at \nthe anarchs: Each and every opponent should be as motivated and goal-oriented as \nthe anarchs themselves. Your players shouldn’t be sitting around the local anarch \nhangout waiting for the next antagonist to show up for a slugfest; they should be \ndealing with enemies who use the same tactics the anarchs are employing, such as \nscouting missions, infiltration attempts, strikes against vital resources, exploitation \nof weaknesses and so on. When convinced that they’re up against a thinking foe, the \ncharacters will feel like they’re at war, and that their victory is anything but \nguaranteed - \nand that is what gives good combat its edge. \nWarring In the Margins: AnarcheIndependent Conflicts \nThough it is less likely than all-out conflict with the sects, never forget that the \nindependent clans have agendas of their own. That means anarchs can quickly \nbecome competition if they try to claim lands or influence the independents consider \nvaluable. While these outsiders may not be able to claim the sheer depth of mundane \nresources that the sects can (though the Giovanni can come close if sufficiently \nroused), they are quite adept within their own niche and are typically much better \nversed at how to defend it from outsiders as well. More than one group of anarchs has \nmoved into a small town or city neighborhood they thought was free, just because it \nhad no sect presence, only to find they’ve intruded on the territory of an independent \nclan and are being targeted for retaliation accordingly. \nWhen plotting these conflicts, then, it is generally best to look at them as akin \nto guerrilla warfare campaigns: Unless the clan in question feels it has sufficient \nstrength to banish or destroy the anarchs outright, it must force them out through \nmore indirect ways. It also means that these clans will not pick fights they do nor feel \nthey can win, but when they do act, they will do so with precision, having carefully \nCHAPTER \nFa: So You WAN A REVOLUTION \n1 49 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Selective assassinations performed by \nskilled Assamites, vicious rumors spread by Setite manipulators, ruthless financial \nmaneuvering by Giovanni corporate officers or destructive cons pulled by canny \nRavnos can all make the anarchs’ unlives unbearable in short order.

And should the Outlander have Lupine allies.. . \nThe Recruiting Ground: Sabbat-Anarch Plots \nIntroducing anarch characters into a Sabbat Chronicle is usually more difficult \nthan bringing the same characters into a Chronicle that focuses on the Camarilla. \nWhile Camarilla elders dislike the revolutionary screeds spouted by their young \ndissidents, they tolerate it a surprising amount of the time. Sabbat Cainites, on the \nother hand, don’t waste time trying to squelch dissent by bringing social or economic \npressure to bear: They’re much more likely to destroy the little crybabies outright. A \ncommon misconception among newly minted anarchs is that the Sabbat is a source \nof potential allies and even comrades in the fight against Camarilla oppression. \nThese newcomers don’t realize that for the Sabbat, “fight” means an all-out war to \nextinguish the enemy, not reform its political institutions! Sabbat Cainites already \nhave equality, as far as they are concerned, so why bother fighting for a cause that’s \nalready won? And the Sabbat’s ideology is aimed at something far more threatening \nthan the petty politics of the Camarilla: the enemy sect’s Antediluvian masters. \nThreats to egalitarianism seem like pretty small potatoes compared to the danger of \nbeing messily devoured by some ravening, millennia-old monster. So there’s not \nmuch chance of the average anarch cell recruiting successfully from established \nSabbat packs they encounter. \nWith that in mind, the Sabbat makes a good antagonist for the all-anarch \nChronicle (see below). Confrontations with the Sword of Caine can be effective \ncontrasts to the more sophisticated conflicts against the Camarilla. Spring the Sabbat \non the anarchs just as the characters are becoming complacent in their struggle against \nthe local court, and watch the tone of the story change quickly. Have a few Sabbat \nvampires call on the anarchs and issue an ultimatum: either join up with us and help \nus take out the local Licks, or we’ll stake you out for the sun too. The anarchs might \ndecide to comply, only to discover that unlife as a Sabbat ally may be as oppressed and \nunfair as being a Camarilla enemy. And what happens if the Sabbat prevails? The \nanarchs may find themselves members of a club that they really don’t want to belong \nto. The anarchs could also decide to shelve their grievances long enough to help the \nCamarilla drive out the invading Sabbat, but then they run the risk of losing any gains \nthey’ve made. Worse, the prince and his supporters might blame the anarchs for \ndrawing the attention of the Sabbat, and make their unlives more miserable than ever. \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n150 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Like most issues dealing with the undead, however, it need only be that \nsimplistic if you want it to. Contrary to popular opinion, the Sabbat does not seek to \nsolve every problem with endless waves of shovelheads or terrorist attacks by the :Black \nHand. It can be quite patient, even seductive when it suits the needs of the sect to \nemploy such methods. The Movement and the Sabbat were born together, after all, and \nespecially once an anarch starts becoming bitter and disillusioned, the promises of the \nSwordofCaine become more and more enticing. For their part, the Sabbat is well aware \nof how easy it is for many anarchs, especially hardliners and others obsessed with \nvictory, to start looking at the sect’s resources and organization and wonder what: they \nmight be able to do with such assets at their disposal. From there, it’s just a few small \nsteps to forging a formal alliance, and then maybe a conversion or two.. .. \nTo that end, if you’re looking for an innovative approach to including the Sword \nof Caine in your Chronicle, resist the temptation to have the Sabbat come asff as \nheavy-handed and thuggish. While they’re perfectly capable of backing up th.reats \nthey make, if they can win converts without a battle, so much the better. After all, \nanarchs are already one step removed from the Camarilla - \nthis makes them that \nmuch more susceptible to the right promises and propaganda, especially if it’s voiced \nby a charismatic Sabbat member who isn’t the raving fanatic the anarchs will expect. \nPatience is definitely required to wait out their initial distrust, and any kind of \nviolence against the anarchs by the Sabbat will ruin it utterly, but once that: first \nbarrier is surpassed things become a lot easier for the recruiter. Many things the \nanarchs feel they need-numbers, \ntraining, resources, etc. -can be provided by the \nSabbat, and their ideals aren’t too terribly different, especially when presented 1sy an \neloquent speaker. Even those anarchs who remain unconvinced should still feel a \ndefinite conflict over what they have heard. \nOf course, if you still wish to run the Sabbat as nightmarish villains in your game, \nby all means go ahead. It is recommended, however, that you augment their physical \nferocity by showcasing their twisted beliefs and practices as well. This not only elevates \nthem beyond the level of mindless antagonists in the eyes of the players, but also adds \nto their horrific effect and further underscores that there but for the grace of Caine go \nthe anarchs themselves. The important thing to remember when running storylines \npitting the anarchs and the Sabbat against each other is that the Sabbat can serve as \na hideous reflection of what the anarchs themselves might become, should they ;illow \ntheir crusade to devour their humanity and become their single all-consuming passion. \nTHF ALL-ANARCH \nCHRONICLF \nSo you want to dispense with the larger sects altogether and tell a story in which all \nor most of the characters are anarchs!

      "text": "The Storytelling advice in this chapter covers this type of Chronicle, too, but \nthere are a few additional considerations to think about before you get started. For \nexample, the character roles deserve special attention. Presumably all these anarchs \nhave at least a nominal leader, and that individual needs to be portrayed by \nsomebody. The other characters will naturally take their cue from the baron, pack \nleader or other authority figure, so consider whether you want to allow these \nleadership roles to develop organically during the course of the game, or if it’s safer \nto cast them and allow any changes to occur naturally as the story proceeds. Next \nyou’ll want to determine exactly whom or what the anarchs are opposing. Are they \nfighting to bring change to a Camarilla-held city that’s recently suffered a mauling \nat the hands of a Sabbat siege? Maybe they’ve elected to make contact with raw \nSabbat recruits who are members of a semi-nomadic pack. The question of loyalty \ncould become key to the story, especially if any of the characters are older anarchs \nwho begin to feel the pull of age and complacency wearing down their will to \ncontinue fighting the good fight. \nThe uniquely anarch option for this type of Chronicle is the nomadic pack, and \nit’s particularly well suited to small troupes (six or less players is a good rule of thumb \nfor a nomadic story). As the anarchs travel from city to city in the name of the Cause, \nthey face perils not only from the Camarilla and the Sabbat, but also from marauding \nLupines, curious mortals, motorcycle-riding witch-hunters and heaven knows what \nother threats. This is a story about the desperation and determination of a tightly knit \ngroup of fellow travelers. This type of Chronicle should be undertaken only by groups \nof players who are already comfortable with one another, because the actions of one \ncharacter can dramatically affect all the others. \nRunning nomadic anarch Chronicles can require a lot of additional work from the \nStoryteller. Every time the characters pack up and set out for a new destination, they \nmust secure shelter, locate sustenance, disguise their identities, dodge pursuers, deal \nwith authorities both mundane and supernatural and keep an eye out for Lupines. Some \nof these activities don’t make for especially interesting game sessions, so you could \nrelegate them to the downtime and narrate them via email, telephone or over coffee. \nAlternately, you could devote a portion of each game session to taking care of the more \nmundane necessities of the nomadic unlifestyle, devising feeding and pursuit tests that \nhelp you reflect all the night-to-night dangers and difficulties facing the anarch road \nwarriors. This type of Chronicle tends to be supporting-cast-heavy, because you’ll need \nto portray the different individuals with whom the players come into contact at stops \nalong their journey. Maybe you have a few friends who weren’t able to commit to a \nregular game schedule but still want to be involved as time permits. No problem! These \nfolks are the perfect choice to help you fill in the roles of the Sabbat packs, sheriffs and \nvampire hunters that your characters are bound to run into. \nTHE FNFMY \nWITHIN \nAnarch characters don’t spend all their time scheming to overthrow the prince \nor planting bombs under cars.

As a consequence, anarchs sometimes spend more time \nfighting one another than their opponents, a fact you should be quick to capitalize \non to keep the Movement fresh and edgy in the minds of your players. \nIf your Chronicle is focused on either of the two larger sects, any internal \nconflicts between anarch characters may spell their doom. Sometimes the seeds of \nthese disagreements are planted by wily Kindred out to pit one anarch against \nanother, while other times they are the natural result of the clashing Natures of two \ncharacters with differing visions of the road to victory against the sects. Or simple \nfrustration at their lack of progress may lead them to turn against one another. \nProvided the source of the conflict is rooted in characters and the story, it’s usually \nsafe to let it ride. Revolutions that fail, and the pattern of their failures, can make for \nvery compelling stories, so allow the player characters to determine their fates \nwithout your help. Only when you notice or sense that the anarchs’ internal \nsquabbling might be based on player relations, rather than those of their characters, \nshould you step in and take the reins. \nSome common conflict archetypes for anarch vs. anarch conflicts are as follows: \nGang vs. Gang \nNaturally enough, anarch gangs can and do fight over everything from revolution- \nary ideals to old grudges to business practices to simple turf wars. A gang devoted to \nfreeing mankind from the influence of vampires entirely and creating a separate \nvampire nation, for instance, is bound to grapple with the other gang across town that \nbelieves vampires are the next stage of evolution and are thus allowed to do as they \nplease with humans. Likewise, two gangs that both wish to control the local drug trade \n- \nor historical societies, or political primaries, or what have you - \nare bound to \nexchange some harsh words unless they can hammer out an agreement both sides find \namenable, and fast. While in theory all gangs are part of the Movement and thus should \nat least respect the divergent views of their fellow revolutionaries, in practice when \ndealing with such a passionate and outspoken group as anarchs, conflict of some kind \nis bound to occur. Even if the players are part of a gang that’s trying to keep the peace \nbetween warring packs, there’s still more than enough material for a good Storyteller \nto keep all sides interested for a long time to come. From political maneuvers and \nbackroom intrigue to bloodshed on the streets, the Masquerade is perhaps the on117 limit \non what gangs will do in a war - \nand even that can be stretched or broken if the battle \nbecomes particularly vicious. If anything, the knowledge that sects will almost certainly \nattempt to exploit the conflict among the anarch ranks only makes these wars that \nmuch more brutal, as all sides seek to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible in order \nto prepare for the inevitable threats from without. \nIn this scenario, serious violence is all but destined to erupt as one gang seeks to \nassert its dominance in an indisputable fashion over another. Furthermore, barring \nintervention by the baron or the local council, such conflict is likely to continue until \none gang is either destroyed, run out of town or so thoroughly broken as to be cowed \ninto submission - \nonce the gauntlet is thrown down, all the gangs involved know \nthat only one of them will come out on top.

Players must not only watch out for \nmembers of gangs with an active rivalry against their own, but also work to make sure \nother gangs in the area aren’t aligning with their rivals. \nSet vs. Set \nIn this tense, tightly wound scenario, the players find themselves part of feuding sets \nin a larger gang. Whether from ideological differences, territory conflicts or personal \nanimosity, they are locked in a struggle to define their own place in the gang and perhaps \npush out or eliminate their rivals in the process. Perhaps one is a younger, up-and-coming \nset that has its eye on territory held by an older set, or maybe a new leader has galvanized \nhis set to challenge for leadership of the gang. Regardless of their composition, the \ndifferent groups find themselves locked in a feud that has no easy resolution. (Or at least \nnone that all parties consider acceptable.) Despite their vows of loyalty, anarchs are still \nas ambitious as any other undead, and when they set their sights on something they are \namazingly persistent. Players find their characters’ loyalties to their sets constantly tested \nas the other side cajoles or threatens them to make them defect to the “winning team,” \nand they must take care to hide their vicious power plays behind a unified front when \nattending gang meetings or facing down mutual enemies. \nUnlike inter-gang warfare, it is much more likely that the different sets must rely \non less direct means in order to achieve their goals - \novert violence not only threatens \nthe gang’s internal stability, but also makes the gang look weak and divided in the eyes \nof its enemies. Sets that try to resolve their conflicts with more than a few simple brawls \nor duels of honor will thus likely find the gang leadership coming down on them \nharshly, possibly even kicking them out if it means saving the reputation of the gang \nas a whole. However, short of that kind of negative attention, all those involved know \nthat anything goes -bribes, blackmail, extortion, theft, rumor-mongering, poaching \nghouls or even the occasional assassination are all par for the course.

And as leaders of \ndifferent gangs, mere proximity to such a deep ideological rival has been known to ignite \nconflicts that set whole cities on fire as the two groups attempt to preserve their territories \nand prove their ideological superiority in the most grimly efficient manner possible. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n154 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Fortunately, there are few problems that can’t be solved \nby working with your players and ensuring that everyone knows the main goal of the \nstory is to have fun! \nMindless Violence \nFor Chronicles that focus on the Camarilla or Sabbat, anarch-sponsored \nmindless violence can be the bane of the entire enterprise. Keep an eye out for anarch \ncharacters who routinely send their enemies to the Final Death in the name of \n“revolution,” especially when there’s no real rationale to do so. Similarly, watch for \nplayers whose Kindred or Cainite characters treat all anarchs as nothing more than \nmoving dirt, and who regularly greet anarch Narrator characters with a barrage of \nlethal Discipline powers. Such a player may be indulging in gratuitous in-character \nviolence, particularly if he defends his actions with an explanation like, “but that’s \nwhat my character’s all about.” In-character motivation is clearly important to each \nplayer’s persona, but it can also be a shield players use to hide from the out-of- \ncharacter consequences of their inappropriate actions. Anarch characters don’t exist \nto be killed on a whim any more than Camarilla or Sabbat characters do. In order for \na Chronicle to thrive and endure, all players must make some concession to the fact \nthat the characters must sometimes co-exist in the same setting. \nThe single most difficult problem that any Laws of the Night game faces when \nanarchs enter the picture is the tension between the in-character violence, crudity \nand disruption that such characters can cause, and the out-of-game feelings of the \nplayers involved. In a game that includes characters plotting one another’s injury and \ndeath, it’s easy to understand how feelings can become frayed and hurt when players \nbelieve the negative treatment their characters receive is a reflection of how other \nplayers think and feel about them in an out-of-game context. The line between in- \ngame and out-of-game conflicts should always be distinct, but unfortunately it \nsometimes grows razor thin. This happens frequently when anarch characters come \ninto play, because such characters are often automatically opposed to whichever \nfaction is currently in power. But true anarchs don’t show up without good reason: \nthey should have a purpose in the game, and their role is as valid and conducive to \na good story as that of any other character. Keep the lines of communication open \nbetween your players, and encourage them to give this material its due. It’s worth \nrestating that you’re not obligated to allow any player to have an anarch character \nif he can’t handle the supporting themes and stories. \nWhy Are We Here? \nWhile Camarilla courts may hold Elysium parties or Sabbat packs gather to \nperform various rites, it may seem that anarchs have less in the way of motivation to \ngather in the numbers that other vampires do. In mixed games, this might not be as \nmuch of a problem, since anarchs are unlikely to be a significant majority, and thus \ntheir major gatherings will probably be player-instigated and held as informal side \ngames outside of the regular play sessions.

Instead, mix up the format as much as possible - \nhave one game be the more standard meeting of the gangs called by the baton to \ndiscuss common objectives, but another be a wild party celebrating a recent victory \n(or the wake of a fallen character or gang). Another game could be an intrigue-laden \nvisit to a nearby Camarilla court staffed by Narrator characters, while yet another \ncould be an exploratory venture into an elder’s recently abandoned haven, etc. Part \nof the charm of playing an anarch is a departure from the same old, same old of the \nsects - \nuse it to your advantage! \nPerhaps you can even work out a schedule of some kind, such as having the baron \ncall a general meeting once every other month, and then allow the actions of the \nplayers to determine what the other sessions will be. Indeed, players whose characters \nroutinely host gatherings for fellow anarchs might gain some Reputation, for \ninstance, as a means of helping promote this way of thinking and encouraging players \nto put together their own gatherings. This allows the players to feel as though their \nactions have a real impact on the nature of the game, and further distances them from \nthe endless Elysium gatherings or tired pack rites of the sects. Just make sure that all \nthe characters have at least some reason to be there-action-oriented characters can \nstill act as bodyguards during more social gatherings, for instance, while more social \ntypes can act as diversions for particularly daring raids. \nFrustration and Boredom \nPlayers of anarch characters can sometimes grow bored with their characters, \nusually because they are frustrated with their inability to make headway against their \nchosen targets, be they Camarilla or Sabbat. This problem is especially common to \nChronicles in which the anarch characters are the decided minority amid a much \nlarger group of Kindred. Players are only human, after all, and as such are much less \npatient than the vampires they are portraying: An anarch character might be willing \nto wait years or even decades to bring a plan to fruition, but her player would like it \nto happen this month. Keep an eye out for players whose anarch characters start off \nstrong on roleplaying but quickly devolve into walking gunslingers, taking potshots \nat any Kindred unlucky enough to stray near them. There’s seldom a clearer \nindication that a player has become bored or frustrated with his character or the story \nthan a sudden shift toward violent in-character behavior. Take a look at the \ncharacter’s goals and think about the scope you’ve established for your game. [s the \ncharacter pursuing achievable goals that are appropriate to your Chronicle? An \nanarch planning to turn his city into the next Free State is probably thinking too big \nfor a sect-based story, and some revision may be in order. \nIf the anarch character’s goals are in line with your story’s scope, resist the \ntemptation to shield her from the consequences of her actions. Anarchs shouldn’t be \nable to get away with murder, literally or figuratively, just because they’re anarchs and \nnot members of a sect. Few things are more frustrating than trying to portray a \nconservative, hard-line Camarilla character and being artificially blocked from \ngiving the local anarchs their just desserts on the grounds that they, too, are player \nCHAPTER \nFIVE: So You WANT A REVOLUTION \n157 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Make sure both sides \nknow the rules and limits for their conflicts, both in-game and out, and realize that \nthey will be held equally accountable. \nOne of the Concepts Is Not Like the Others \nDon’t be afraid to say no to a character concept that just doesn’t mesh well with \nthe underlying principles of the Anarch Movement or the overall scheme of your \nChronicle. That’s part of your role as the Storyteller, and your players look to you to \nmake sure all characters are appropriate to the story. While it’s always to the benefit of \nyour Chronicle to think outside the common stereotypes, that doesn’t mean some \nguidelines aren’t helpful and necessary. Characters who are associated with the anarchs \nfirst and foremost need some plausible reason to become affiliated with the Movement. \nWhile logical rationales can run the gamut from a desire to effect genuine social \nchange among the damned to simply seeking new thrills on a Saturday night, some \nmotivations just don’t make sense. ATzimisce isn’t going to voluntarily join up with \nthe Anarch Movement because he just doesn’t have any stake in working toward a \nreformed Camarilla, not to mention the fact that merely considering such a move \nprobably forfeits his unlife in the unforgiving eyes of his clan. The same is true for the \nGiovanni and many Followers of Set: Their respective agendas are progressing just \nfine without the necessity of hooking up with a bunch of social and political outcasts, \nthank you very much. \nLast, be on the lookout for players who confuse “anarch” with “unstoppable \nCaitiff killing machine with wild and crazy Disciplines,” “min-maxed super thug,” or \nany other character with the maximum possible number of advantageous Traits and \nvery little personality to back it up. Such players are likely to try to use these same \nunlikely Trait combinations as part of the reason they joined in the first place - \n“I’m \nan outcast because, uh, I killed a whole lot of people and, um, everybody was jealous \nof my massive studliness” -but \ndon’t let them bully you just because they took the \ntime to write some stats down on paper. Just because a Trait is available in a book \ndoesn’t mean it’s available in your game, especially if it looks like the player has \nchosen it for sheer power as opposed to playing a more interesting character. First and \nforemost, a character must be able to make a positive contribution to the game, \notherwise she doesn’t belong. You should always feel free to deny a concept that’s not \nappropriate to your Chronicle; the long-term benefits of doing so far outweigh the \nshort-term hassle, not least because your other players will thank you for choosing a \ngood story over rote game mechanics. \nTHE ANARCH GIDE \n158 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "FIRST \nAMONG \nEQUALS \nANARCH \nREPUTATION \nMuch as they might claim otherwise, anarchs have no real structure and most \ngangs function independently of others, meeting occasionally in raves to exchange \nwar stories and compare notes on how to achieve their goals. As such, they pride \nthemselves on being above the petty social games of the Camarilla or the savage \ninfighting of the Sabbat, where wars spanning centuries have been waged about \nperceived slights against one’s good name and a single scandal or defeat can spell the \nend of a centuries-old Kindred. However, this is not to say that anarchs don’t play \ngames of their own regarding standing within the Movement and the respect of their \npeers; they just go about it a bit differently than their fellow Kindred do. Unlike the \nsects, an anarch’s Reputation is not based on position, rites or generation- indeed, \neven a ghoul can have a Reputation among the anarchs. Rather, revolutionaries gain \nor lose Reputation by their deeds alone, as judged by their comrades-in-arms. In an \nabstract sense, this should mean that merit and personal achievement on the part of \ndedicated revolutionaries are rewarded without the vicious trappings of conven- \ntional status games. \nIn practice, however, it means that some anarchs spend as much time building \nand defending their Reputations as many sect members spend pursuing Status in \nthe eyes of their peers. They become like inner-city gang lords who mock the \ncountry clubs and society snobbery of the city’s elite, only to turn around and \nviciously destroy those who offer them even the slightest hint of disrespect. Or as \none anarch sage wryly noted: “A lot of the neonates keep using a high school \nmetaphor that depicts us as the rebels and outsiders pitted against the fashionable \nCamarilla in-crowd or the tough Sabbat jocks. They forget that even the outcasts \nstill have a pecking order.” Seeing only the possible gains that come from carving \nout their own niches, these anarchs fail to realize that they are perpetuating the \nsame power games they claim to despise, selling out their principles for the sake of \na name that inspires respect. \nMake no mistake, however - \neven anarchs who pursue such good standing \nwith their peers recognize that it is still fundamentally different from the more \nrigid and codified systems of the sects. When your approval rests in the hands of \nthe mob, however sympathetic that mob may generally be, you’re standing on \nthin ice, and anarchs concerned with their Reputations are well aware of it. \nWhile an anarch’s Reputation may carry throughout the Movement and inspire \nfear or respect in revolutionaries across the country, individuals still suffer no \npenalty whatsoever for ignoring it except whatever punishment the anarch can \nbring down on the upstart. In other words, a Reputation is worth as much pull as \nthe audience wants to give it, so canny anarchs don’t try to ride Reputation alone, \nor they risk losing it quickly. It’s a simple truth: If you abuse your Reputation, you \nwill lose it. \nBut if you can hold on to it.. . such are legends made of. \nTHE ANARCH GJIDE \n174 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

See the section below for how to handle \ngains and losses among this volatile group. \nSee Laws of the Night, page 216, for more details on common uses for \nReputation and how to apply this valuable commodity in vampire society. \nGAINING \nAND LOSING \nREPUTATION \nTemporary Reputation Change \nLosing or gaining temporary ReputationTraits is incredibly easy. All it takes to \naward or remove a temporary Reputation Trait is a majority vote of the anarchs \npresent at any particular gathering, not including the character in question. (Thus, \na solitary anarch cannot vote himself into a great deal of Reputation in this manner, \nsince it is intended to indicate the current “buzz” of the local anarch community.) \nThis informal vote can be conducted at any time during the evening, or even on \nmultiple occasions during particularly wild or unpredictable nights. A character still \nmay not gain more temporary Reputation than twice the number of permanent \nReputation Traits she has in this fashion (including Committed) - \neven a burst of \napproval from one’s peers is not enough to truly radically alter a character’s standing. \nHowever, anarchs who routinely receive a lot of positive temporary Reputation in \nthis fashion are often leading candidates to receive more permanent Reputation \nawards at the next big rave. Exactly how often such changes take place depends on \nthe anarchs inquestion-some \nmore stable gangs seldom call suchvotes, while more \npolitical packs may call for these votes constantly. In the end, the anarchs themselves \ndecide when such opinion polls are necessary. \nSystem: Any time during a session that a majority of the anarch characters \npresent (not necessarily the majority of the anarchs in the game as a whole) are \nassembled, they may call a vote to award or remove temporary ReputationTraits from \nany anarch present. Once the matter has been discussed to the group’s satisfaction, \na vote is called: on a count of three, everyone with the CommittedTrait holds thumbs \nup if in favor of the change, thumbs down if opposed or a plain fist if abstaining. A \nsimple majority wins. There are no appeals for these changes, save to attempt to call \nanother vote later on to reverse the decision. To call each such “appeal” vote costs \none temporary Reputation Trait, however, so wise anarchs know when popular \nopinion has shifted against them and don’t further squander their good names trying \nto win back respect. Unless otherwise noted or agreed upon by the Storyteller and the \ntroupe, temporary Reputation shifts arising from these informal votes last only until \nthe end of the session. \nEven in this informal forum, an anarch must demonstrate some basis for \ndeserving an increase or decrease in temporary Reputation -players \ncannot simply \nstand in a circle and award each other temporary Reputation up to their maximums. \nThose who attempt to do so should be severely reprimanded, or else the spirit of the \nsystem and the balance of the game will be thrown out of alignment. As Reputation \nis still handled through the Storyteller or the Gossip (if the game has one), this \nshouldn’t be an issue, but should a question arise a troupe may make it a policy that \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDL \n176 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

At truly large, contentious or rowdy gatherings the \nStoryteller may require that the speaker spend a temporary Reputation Trait in order \nto get the crowd’s attention; failure means they simply don’t pay enough attention \nto the character for her to call a proper vote. This process can take some time if the \ncrowd has questions or if they attempt to drown out the speaker, and may require a \nSocial Test or two to decide in the event of evenly matched opposition. \nProvided the speaker can get the crowd to listen, the would-be recipient’s \nactions are recounted and voted on as to whether or not they are deserving of the \nReputation Trait in question. Likewise, to remove an accolade or assign a negative \nReputation Trait, someone must propose the need for punishment and relate the \nreason(s) why she feels the accused character does not deserve to be known as \nHardcore any longer, for example. \nRemember that a proper anarch gathering, as defined by the city’s anarchs \nthemselves (formally or otherwise), is always required in order to call votes that carry \npermanent weight. It is also usually required that most if not all of the city’s active \nanarchs be present to provide a properly representative body, though this can vary \nin times of emergency or other dire need. Barring truly exceptional circumstances, \nan anarch may not gain more than one permanent positive Reputation Trait per rave, \nthough he may lose as many positive or gain as many negative Reputation Traits as \nhis fellow anarchs see fit. \nSystem: Assuming the speaker can get the word out, a vote is called to represent \nwhether or not the assembled anarchs feel the change is justified. The voting process \nis simple - \non a count of three, each character with the Committed Trait holds \nthumbs up for “yes,” thumbs down for “no” or a plain fist for “abstain.” When \nremoving an existing positive Reputation Trait or assigning a negative Reputation \nTrait, a simple majority carries, while awarding a new positive Trait requires a 2/3 \nmajority approval - \nit’s a lot easier to lose respect than gain it, after all. Removing \na negative Reputation Trait is described in the section relating to these Traits. Even \nghouls can gain or lose Reputation at a rave, though generally speaking they must \naccomplish at least twice as much as a vampire would in order to be eligible for the \nsame Trait. If the vote passes, the Reputation Trait is awarded immediately, and \ncannot be removed until at least the next gathering, barring evidence of fra.ud or \nblame being placed unfairly on a target. \nNote that this is not necessarily or even usually considered an actual in-game \nhand-raising vote, though some anarch groups might well decide to make it one. \nRather, it is intended as an out-of-game mechanic to determine whether the crowd \nis sufficiently swayed or not.

Failure to repay an important favor has been the flashpoint for \nmore than one bloody conflict in the Movement, and making good on your debts and \ncollecting on what others owe you is a large part of maintaining one’s Reputation. \nHere’s the trickypart: The fluid and highly subjective natureofanarchReput ation \nmeans that to really maintain it well, you must act like you don’t care about it. \nAttempting to enforce your superior “standing” with an iron fist is bound to fail in the \nlong term- as soon as you become known for trying to get by on your celebrity or being \nan absolute bully about demanding repayment for debts others owe you, a nasty \nbacklash is sure to crop up. Anarchs may love a hero, but they hate a tyrant more. The \nmore overtly an anarch seeks Reputation, the less chance he has of finding it. \nConversely, the less outwardly concerned he is with his “rep,” the more likely he is to \nreceive one from his peers. It’s a strange cycle, but true in practice nevertheless,. \nWhen dealing with the anarchs and such delicate matters as debts and prestation, \nthen, the difference is primarily one of style and subtlety- though they would be loath \nto admit it, anarchs essentially respect many of the same rules concerning repaying \ndebts and paying proper respect. They just approach it differently than other vampires \ndo. While a Camarilla prince might speak of a “life boon” or formally announce that \nhe is calling in “a prestation debt” to gather support for his latest project, an anarch \nwould handle the matter much more casually - \nbut no less seriously. She might remind \nher friend of the time she stuck her neck out for him, and implore him to pay her back \nwith an equal display of friendship; the words and the approach are different, but the \nmeaning is essentially the same as honoring a “life boon.” Likewise, an anarch looking \nto make a play for baron of the local territory might remind her ally of the time she stood \nup for him during a rave where his Reputation was taking a beating, and ask him to \nthrow his support behind her during her current campaign. While neither would admit \nit, this is essentially the same as a “prestation debt.” \nOnce again, it’s all aquestionofstyle- how toremind others ofyourstation or what \nthey owe you without calling too much attention to the fact that you are doing so. It’s a \ntrick that can take centuries to master, but it’s vital for any anarchs who seek to build a \nlasting Reputation among their kind. Players and Storytellers are thus encouraged to \nreward players who make an effort to understand and embrace the uniquely anarch style \nof handling boons and prestation, while at the same time discouraging other player:; who \ntry to handle it as simply the Camarilla Status system with a nose ring. \nRFPUTATION \nTRAITS \nAn anarch can generally have up to eight Reputation Traits, subject to Storyteller \ndiscretion. Areas with a higher concentration of anarchs tend to allow for more \nvariation in Reputation levels, reflecting the developing hierarchy of the local \nrevolutionaries and the potential for greater advancement with the presence of a larger \npower base.

      "text": "more established cities. In either case an anarch‘s Reputation can still come and go far \nmore rapidly than in the Camarilla or even in the Sabbat, as outlined above. \nSince the anarchs recognize no formal offices as such - even the most \nprestigious baron still technically occupies an unofficial post - \nthe only way to earn \nReputation is to become known for a particular accomplishment or talent. While it \nis theoretically possible to lie about one’s deeds to gain Reputation, doing so is rarely \nanything but an invitation to disaster when one’s true past is eventually revealed. \nThe possible reward is just not worth the potential consequences, as most such liars \nand frauds quickly discover to their dismay. While anarchs may not be as formal about \nReputation as their sect counterparts, that doesn’t mean they enjoy being lied to any \nmore than anyone else does, especially by their “comrades.” \nIn addition to the standard Status Traits provided in Laws of the Night (many \nof which can just as easily apply to anarchs, especially more “established” types such \nas barons or emissaries), some important new Traits include: \nAdvocate, Believer, Champion, Preacher. These degrees of Reputation recog- \nnize how well known an anarch is for teaching independent or sect-aligned vampires \nabout the true ideals of the Anarch Revolt, gathering recruits or defusing tensions \nborn of misunderstanding. \nBond/Bond Girl. The anarch is a successful spy within one of the larger sects, \nwhether a simple observer or actively working to undermine it from within. \nCommitted. The vampire has proven her dedication to the ideals of the Anarch \nRevolt as well as her loyalty to her fellow anarchs after a suitable probationary period \nand/or trial by fire. Once received, this Trait cannot be removed short of the holder’s \ndecision to leave the Movement or being permanently banished from the ranks of the \nanarchs as a result of betrayal, chronic incompetence, etc. \nHardcore. The anarch has gone above and beyond the call of duty and placed \nherself directly in harm’s way in order to complete a mission of great importance to \nthe Movement even in the face of superior odds, serious personal objections, grave \ndanger of Final Death or other overwhelming factors. \nLoaded, Hmk-Up, Connected. The anarch is well knownas atrusted source ofnecessary \nresources: money and equipment, information or Influence-based favors, respectively. \nMarked. Through her actions in pursuit of the goals of the Movement, the \nanarch has become the target of a Blood Hunt, War Party or even placed on the \ninfamous Red List. This may be a negative Reputation Trait in areas where the \nanarchs are trying to keep a low profile. \nSoldier, Warrior, Veteran, Lifer. Each time an anarch survives a protracted \nsiege, pitched battle or similar major tactical undertaking-not just araid or a minor \nbrawl - \nshe receives one of these Traits. Additional victories beyond this number \nsimply increase the degree of respect granted. \nTested. An anarch who has survived a successful planned raid or similar \norganized minor conflict may receive this Trait. It is only received once, after the first \nsuch clash the vampire survives; after that the anarch is expected to know how to take \ncare of himself in such situations. \nTHE ANARCH \n&]DE \n180 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "True Believer. The anarch has gone above and beyond the call of duty to \ndirectly place himself in harm’s way for the sake of spreading the ideals of the Anarch \nRevolt. Most often given to recruiters and emissaries who risk Final Death to spread \nthe ideals of the Movement in actively hostile cities. \nVisionary. The anarch has become known for proposing new and useful ideas \nrelated to the Cause, whether a more amicable way to divide hunting grounds \nbetween a city’s gangs, a better method to gather Influence in local government or \na tactical plan that saved the city from a Sabbat invasion. \nStorytellers should feel free to define more Reputation Traits that apply to a \nparticular gang, territory or even to the Movement as a whole. Make the Reputation \nin your chronicle match the style of the anarchs represented as well as the raves and \noverall theme you are looking to create. \nThe anarchs also define a number of standard negative Reputation Traits. (As \nwith positive Reputation Traits, feel free to add more that suit your chronicle.) An \nanarch member may possess two of these at any given moment. Recently awarded \nnegative Traits displace older ones as far as game mechanics go, though that doesn’t \nmean the anarchs have forgotten past indiscretions - \ntheir ire is simply focused in \nanother direction at the moment. Generally speaking, a vampire can earn the \nremoval of the Trait by twice successfully completing whatever task he failed at to \nearn the negative Trait in the first place, or by publicly and conclusively clearing his \nname in the matter of a false accusation. \nBurnt Out. This Trait goes to anarchs who have demonstrated a distinct: lack \nof enthusiasm for the Cause, as well as those who have been heard to belittle or \notherwise downplay the importance of the Anarch Revolt in general. \nCasualty. The anarch has become careless, whether in word or deed, and in \nso doing placed fellow revolutionaries in direct danger. The not-so-subtle implica- \ntion is that if the anarch doesn’t shape up soon, no one will back him the next time \nhe is under fire. \nCherry. This Trait goes to anarchs who exhibit a dangerous nayvet6 ab0u.t the \nMovement, their gang’s goals or even just unlife in general. That said, only the most \nmilitant packs generally give this Trait just for being new to the Cause; most of the \ntime a vampire’s inexperience has to have caused serious problems or even bodily \nharm to fellow anarchs before this Trait applies. \nDefeated. The anarch recently lost a battle. This does not generally apply to \nsituations where the only sane response would be to take flight, such as one anarch \nfacing a horde of Sabbat, but does apply to any fair fights the anarch lost. This also \napplies to anarchs who lose a personal duel. \nOverzealous. The vampire’s refusal to compromise personal beliefs (generally \nhypocritical self-important ones) has led her to needlessly endanger the welfare of \nother anarchs or even the city as a whole. \nThug. Simply put, the anarch is too eager to start a fight or otherwise put \nhimself (and often others) directly at risk, even when it’s not the best option \navailable. Use your fists instead of your wits too often, and this Trait will find you. \nCHAPTER Sn FACE IN ME CROWD \n181 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Unenlightened. Even after having them explained to her, the anarch cannot \nremember the details of essential components of the Anarch Revolt, such as the \nhistory of the Cause, the importance of the Convention of Thorns, the principles of \nthe Status Perfectus and so on. Usually awarded to an anarch who publicly \ndemonstrates such ignorance, especially in front of members of the sects. \nUnreliable. The vampire failed to perform some key duty for his gang, generally \none that was explicitly outlined in the past and which the anarch is well aware it is \nhis responsibility to fulfill. \nVain (also known as Cocky, Full of Himself or comparable terms). The vampire \nclaims mastery of some field in which she goes on to fail publicly, preferably in an \nimpressive or even physically dangerous way. This Trait commemorates acts of \nunsuccessful hubris of all kinds. \nKEEPING \nREPUTATION \nIN PFRSPECTIVF \nAlways remember that Reputation Traits quantify something that’s hazy and \nsubjective to characters in the World of Darkness. Reputation is fluid, personalized \nand subject to change without muchnotice. A character can ride avictory to the top \nof the world one night, only to find the backlash surrounding his next failure that \nmuch more intense since he has become a figure of public renown and the others \n“expected better” of him. Players should acknowledge the natural give-and- take of \nthis system and take all gains and losses in stride, as well as recognize that just because \nthe other characters voted to give them a negative Reputation Trait, that doesn’t \nmean the other players have it in for them. As long as they keep that distinction in \nmind, most troupes can run the rough-and-tumble majority rule system presented \nhere without a problem. \nHowever, if it starts becoming an out-of-game popularity contest or causing \nharsh feelings between players who feel they’re being passed over for Reputation or \nunfairly assignednegativeTraits, change it. There are more anarchsout there than just \nthe players’ characters, after all, and as such you’re perfectly entitled to rule that the \nlarger anarch population (i.e. you the Storyteller) is the final arbiter of all Reputation \nadjustments. Or you may come up with an entirely different method of tracking \nReputation unique to your game: So long as you and your players enjoy it, that’s what \nmatters. The bottom line is that the reality of Reputation - \nsuperior and inferior \nrank, as well as recognition of brilliant or foolish deeds - \nexists even among the \nsupposedly egalitarian anarchs, and you can portray it in lots of ways. Rules should \nalways serve the chronicle, not the other way around. \nTHE ANARCH \nG~IDE \n182 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Firefighters are still \nclearing the scene, but it looks like a total loss.” \n“How did it happen?” Her eyes never left the young musician, who had switched \nfrom painfully exquisite classical guitar to a rollicking blues number. \n“According to our sources in the eighth precinct, witnesses are telling police \nthat a gang of men in ‘punk‘ clothes burst through the door, assaulted the maitrC’d \nand ordered the staff and the customers to leave. Then they spread some kind of \naccelerant over the restaurant, shouted something about ‘death to all fascists’ and ran \nout of the building. A few seconds later there was a loud explosion and the (entire \nplace went up in flames.’’ \n“It sounds like their work, but how can we be sure it wasn’t just some kine of \nsimilar disposition?” Her words were quiet, measured, without a hint of irritation. \n“These things can happen, even in our fair city.” \n“I asked our sources that too, ma’am. They passed along this information, which \nat my request they’ve agreed to keep out of the press. There was a message this time.” \nHe produced a paper from his pocket and handed it to her. It read: KNIGHTS \nTERRITORY NOW OR YOUR MASQUERADE BURNS TOO. \nhLUDE: SACRIFICES \n5 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nShe considered it for a few moments, then dismissed the servant with a wave of \nher hand. When she looked up, the room was quiet, several sets of unblinking eyes \ntrained on her. \n‘‘I assume you all heard what just happened,” she said wryly. \n“Damn right we did!” An intense-looking young man with several body \npiercings and a number of prominent tattoos rose from his chair and began pacing \nnervously around the room. “They’re going to ruin everything!” In his corner, a \nnumber of nearly identical gang members murmured noises of agreement. \n“They don’t understand how this system works,” the guitarist concurred, setting \ndown his instrument and settling back comfortably into the embrace of several \nbeautiful, vacant-eyed female admirers. “We have been more than reasonable about \nallowing them a chance to find a place in the city before, but now.. .” He shrugged. \n“Something must be done. As always, though,” he nodded deferentially to the young \nwoman, “we’ll follow your lead, Miss D.” \nAll eyes turned to back to the young woman, waiting. At last she said: “I think \nwe know what has to be done. They’ve overstepped their authority after repeated \nwarnings, and there’s only one punishment I can think of for that: It’s time we called \nthe Saracen and had him take care of it.” She looked around for signs of disapproval, \nfound none, and nodded once. “It’s decided.” \n“This problem ends tonight.” \n“. . . So then1 heard this story from CitizenTop, this crazy asshole over in the UK. \nHe has this theory that ‘Clan Toreador’ doesn’t really exist - \nit’s all just a big \nMalkavian prank!” Rick paused, the din of the pounding techno in the background \nunderscoring his words. “Yeah, he says that every stinkin’ one of them he’s ever met \nis really a Setite, or a Caitiff, or some other weirdo trying to pass themselves off as one \nof the Degenerates, and he ain’t met an actual Degenerate yet, so it must be some kind \nof big Lunatic joke!” \nA1 threw his head back from the neck of one of the pretty young things they’d \npicked up and laughed loudly along with the others. He sounded almost as drunk as \nhis giggling vessel. “Hey Carver, aren’t you supposed to have been one of those Tory \nAdores back in the day? You wanna set our boy Rick straight?” \nCarver turned and glared from his post by the rickety front door. “Leave me \nalone, guys, I’m on watch.” He twirled his favorite silver knife absently in one hand \nas he watched the party, dancing it across his fingers almost faster than the human \neye could follow. \n“For what?” Rick yelled back, still laughing. “You think those stuffy bastards are \ngonna take us on after the number we did on their place tonight? Damn, man, they \nwouldn’t have the nuts to come at this place with so many witnesses around, \nespecially in such a ghetto ‘hood like this. We got them beat.” \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n6 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n“Long live the Anarch Revolt, baby! Knights uber alles!” A1 saluted the air with \nan upraised fist, followed immediately by Rick and the other Knights. “Hell, yeah!” \nthey chorused in unison, and then the victory party revved back to a deafening, \n7 roar. \n“Idiots,” Carver muttered, grinning just slightly. His smile faltered ab-ruptly \nwhen he realized that he hadn’t felt his knife in his hand for several momeni:s and \nhadn’t heard it hit the floor either. Turning back to the door, he had just enough time \nto register the shadowy form advancing on him before the knife sliced down in asilver \narc. His head flew free, a look of surprise still written across its features. \nIt was more warning than the others had. \nOnly moments later a thoroughly unremarkable individual walked calmly but \npurposefully away from the house and vanished into thenight. Inside, the first sparkscaught \nand the dull orange glow began seeping through the windows as the fire flared into life. \n. . .  \n‘‘. . . Is this what you call justice?Half adozen ofour fellow anarchs and their mortal \nfriends murdered in their home, for the sake of a single restaurant?’’ In life, I3ailey \nCarlton had been a political scientist with a compelling talent for public speaking; in \nundeath, his speeches were rapidly becoming known throughout the Movement for \ntheir power and revolutionary fire. Sure enough, no sooner had he finished his latest \nquestion than an explosive roar of No’s and Hell No’s erupted from the crowd. \n“All the Knights ever asked for is what any of the rest of us want - \na place to \ncall our own, a place where we can be free to feed as we choose and dictate the way \nwe run our own unlives in peace.” Bailey slammed a fist on the podium, his own \noutrage rising along with the crowd. “I ask you, Prince Elena, why did the Knights \nhave to die for your petty territoriality?” Bailey’s voice suddenly rose to an accusation \nthat sounded more like the thunder of avengeful god to the ears of his audience. “Why \ndid you have to kill to keep them silent?” \nJust beyond the back of the crowd a small knot of individuals had gathered, their \nleather jackets and rebellious symbols blending in with the rest of the rowdy throng even \nif the looks in their eyes did not. “The kid really is excellent,” remarked one off-hancledly \nas the crowd gave another primal howl of agreement. “I gotta admit, I’m impressed. Only \nsix days after the fact, and he’s already drawn at least three dozen strong.” \n“Better than we could’ve hoped,” agreed another of the group, crossing his \nheavily tattooed arms as though to ward off the noise. “Almost too good, actually. \nThey’re going crazy out there.” \n“Best to make the call now, then. The sooner this is over with, the better we all \ncome out of it.” At that, one of the group broke off, threaded through the sparse crowd \nof toughs by the back door and flipped open a cell phone as he walked out into the \nnight, leaving the din of the crowd behind him. \nA few words later, the last play of the plan was underway. \nhLUDL: SACRIFICES \n1 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n0\n.\n.\n \n“We both know I have you here as a courtesy only, ‘baron.”’ Prince Elena swiveled \nher chair away from her view of the downtown district, regarding her guests with a \ncondescending smile that didn’t quite reach her icy blue eyes. “So make this quick.” \n“I don’t really think you’re in a position to speak to me that way at the moment.” \nDaron smiled back at her adversary, equally fierce. “For the past week, anarch packs \nhave come been coming from as far away as Maine and the Carolinas after we put the \nword out about the untimely death of the Knights. I can assure you that they won’t \nbe satisfied with the usual ‘be patient and we’ll get to you someday’ crap that we’ve \ngotten in the past.’’ \n“Are you threatening me?” Elena meant the words to sound low and ominous, \nbut there it was, just a hint of anxiety. That was all Daron needed to see - \nthis battle \nwas over in every way except the negotiation of the cease-fire terms. \n“It’s not my fault you stepped in it deep, and truth be told it’s not my job to \nprotect you from the consequences either. Right now most of my people want to light \nthis city up and your crew along with it, and let’s be honest here. We both know that \nif I let things get ugly right now, your sheriff and his goons couldn’t handle the \nnumbers we’ve mustered. Even if you got lucky and managed to hold us off, you’d be \nso weak that I’m sure Bishop Santiago up the river would just love to make a grab for \nthe city.” Daron let this sink in for a moment, and when Elena said nothing, she \ncontinued. “On the other hand, with just a little effort I can disperse the worst of these \ntroublemakers, and not only save you a lot of grief but also keep Santiago from daring \nto make a move in the bargain.” \n“And what would 1 owe you for this generous favor?” Elena’s word dripped \nsarcasm, but her eyes were defeated. \n“Full feeding rights and territorial autonomy, for my own group and the other \nestablished anarch packs in the city. We stay out of your business, agree to police our \nown people, and in return you consent to stop the scourge from bothering any of us \never again.” Daron flashed a victorious smile. “DO we have a deal?” \nElena stewed for a moment, just long enough to save face, then shook her head \nsadly. “Against my better judgment, I will agree to honor your terms, rather than risk \nthe safety of my city at the hands of the Sword of Caine.” \nDaron and her small entourage rose to leave, Sam zipping his guitar back into \nits case while Shane gestured for his waiting gang ghouls to bring him his jacket. As \nthey were stepping through the door, Elena called after them: “Awfully convenient, \nthose little bastards getting killed so soon after they burned my restaurant down, \ndon’t you think? Couldn’t have worked out better for you if you’d planned it.” \nDaron turned in the doorway, her face and voice absolutely neutral. “Every one \nof us swears to die for the cause if that’s what it takes to achieve the goals of the \nMovement. It’s just that not everybody gets to choose when they’ll be called on to \nactually do it.” With that, she closed the door, leaving Elena alone with her troubled \nthoughts and her troubled city. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDL \n8 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nc \ne \nPRELUDE: SACNFICES \n9 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nYou’re only punk once \nSo you’d better do it right. \n- \nGood Clean Fun, “You’re Only Punk Once” \nWelcome to The Anarch Guide, the concluding volume in the series outlining \nthe major vampiric societies in the modem World of Darkness, the Anarch \nMovement. Kindred of all kinds follow the banner of the Anarch Revolt, from fiery \nrabble-rousers and passionate intellectuals to zealous warriors and cunning infiltra- \ntors. It doesn’t matter how pure your blood is or what your sire did six centuries ago; \nwhat matters is what you have to offer. Revolution is here - \nthe only question now \nis whether you’re in or you’re out. \nBefore we get into the history of the anarchs and the unique culture and talents \nthey’ve developed, however, a few additional concerns need addressing. Please take \na moment and repeat after me: \nThis book is about a game that involves fictional characters in a fictional setting. It \nis not a terrorist handbook, and I am not a revolutionary. Reading this book or playing a \ncharacter bused on this material does not entitle me to break stuff, steal things, hurt people \nor commit any other wantonly antisocial acts just because it’s “in character.” Nor should \nit be considered an excuse to heedlessly discuss vicious executions, building bombs or other \npotentially menacing activities in locations or situations where people who are not playing \nthis game are likely to overhear these remarks, take them out of context and summon the \nauthorities. Accidents happen, but I will do my best to avoid them us much as possible, and \nas amature individual I will take responsibility for helping clear up any problems that do arise \nfrom such mistakes. \nThis may sound a bit extreme, but it is written with your safety and the safety of \nyour group in mind. Many of the topics covered in this book have- \neven in the context \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \nIO \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof a game - \nrecently become extremely sensitive subjects in our post-9/11 society. As \nsuch, even well-meaning and responsible players can accidentally attract a lot of \nunwanted attention for actions or remarks that wouldn’t have raised an eyebrow a few \nyears back. When you combine this new heightened sensitivity with the fact that you \nare playing a game that also involves costumes, lingo and behavior that most normal \npeople don’t understand to begin with, things can very easily be taken out of context \nin a negative way. Hotel security probably won’t stop to ask if you’re playing a game \nbefore kicking you out when other guests report that you and your friends in the lobby \nare discussing building bombs, and the diner staff may feel quite justified in calling the \npolice when they overhear those guys in fatigues discussing how to move a load of \nautomatic weapons into the city. And let’s not start to think about what even open- \nminded parents might do these days if they hear their kid talking to those weird-looking \nnew friends about planning a violent “raid” of any kind.. . \nStorytellers and players are therefore encouraged to get together before the game \nbegins and go over any guidelines they feel may be necessary to avoid potential \nincidents and keep things running smoothly. Many such alterations are surprisingly \neasy to implement, especially considering the amount of trouble they prevent in the \nlong term. For example, games held in public venues might well consider using the \n“Bunny-Hop Rule.” This simple rule requires that players substitute potentially \nmenacing nouns like “gun” or “knife” with the word “bunny” and equally problematic \nverbs such as “shoot” or “stab” with the word “hop.” This may sound silly at first, but \nif you’re playing in a nightclub or college lounge with a lot of ordinary people within \nearshot, which would you rather hear an overly excited player accidentally shout: \n“He’s got a gun! Shoot him!” Or “He’s got a bunny! Hop him!”? The former outburst \ncould easily spark a minor riot and possibly a call to the authorities as well, while the \nlatter remark is much less likely to result in a bad scene, especially if your players are \notherwise abiding by the rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre and not doing anything \nimmature such as carrying weapon props. \nIn short, while you should feel free to enjoy this book, this game and the character \nyou play, you should also remember that no game is played in a vacuum. Unless you’re \nplaying in aprivate space where your game is guaranteed to have absolutely no contact \nwith “mundanes” (and possibly sometimes even then), bear in mind that you have a \nresponsibility to your game and your group to make sure that your actions don’t unduly \nalarm or intimidate non-players. Remember those core guidelines for all Minds Eye \nTheatre chronicles, The Only Rules That Matter, and take extra care to Be Mindful \nof Others. Play hard, but play responsibly - \ndon’t do or say things that might get you \nor your game bounced from your location, much less anything that could likely result \nin someone summoning the authorities. Not only is doing so utterly bad form if not \noutright criminal), but it’s disruptive to the game in general and a grave dissemice to \nyour Storyteller and fellow players as well. Don’t do it. \nFor the 99.9% of you who don’t need this disclaimer to game safely and \nresponsibly, read on and have fun. \nINRODUCTORY \nDISCLAIMER \n11 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe possibility that we may fail in the struggle \nought not to deter us from the support ofa cause we \nbelieve to be just. - \nAbraham Lincoln \nAN INTRODUCTION \nTO THF CAUSF \nAlthough the image of anarchs as little more than foul-mouthed young hooli- \ngans in leather jackets hurling insults at Elysium likely has some small basis in fact, \nthe truth is that the history of the Anarch Movement suggests afar deeper motivation \nfor committed anarchs than simple rebellion. The anarchs’ history is one of the most \ntragic and most passionate stories in the annals of Caine’s descendants. Despite \ncountless defeats and setbacks, not to mention active predation by the two most \ndeadly sects to stalk the night, true anarchs have always returned to champion their \nbeliefs, even to a society that largely reviles them for doing so. \nEven first-generation converts - \nthose who leave another sect to joiin the \nMovement -do so out of a sense that the anarchs, for all their flaws, are fundamentally \ncorrect about the injustice of Kindred society. Many Kindred who dislike certain \naspects of Camarilla society still remain within its bounds because it is familiar and, to \na certain degree, safe. Likewise, while the debauched excesses and brutal conflicts of the \nSabbat horrify even some of its most jaded members, the majority remain if for no other \nreason than because they cannot envision surviving the night without a strong group \nto belong to. Suffer though they might from disorganization, the anarchs represent an \nalternative to these unliving systems, a freedom the Camarilla denies and the Sabbat \nmocks.. . but that still never seems to die. \nCHAmER ONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHK \n13 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSo as the history book opens and the tragic and triumphant tale of the Anarch \nRevolt unfolds, the question becomes not why to play an anarch, but indeed, why not \nto play one. \nTHE CLIMATE \nOFTHF RFVOLT \nThe 14th century was one of the worst periods in recent history to be a Cainite \nin Europe. Between the growing power of the Inquisition, invading armies in the east, \nand the advent of mortal diseases (such as the Black Death) that could send vampires \ninto torpor, many Cainites wanted nothing more than to disappear from the world \nentirely and be left alone. In the midst of these threats, many elders decided to do \nexactly that, choosing solitude and self-preservation over their feudal obligations to \nprotect their childer. Refusing to accept and react to anunfavorable situation the way \nthe elders had, neonates of Europe took their cue from mortal revolts to create their \nown destiny, to seize the freedom and rights they desired from their oppressive sires. \nThus was conceived what would become the Anarch Movement. \nTheir response was well timed. By the beginning of the 13th century, the Church \nhad begun stepping up efforts to combat heresy, by appointing specialized judges who \nanswered only to the pope, chosen from the new Dominican and Franciscan priestly \norders. Within the Dominican order grew the Society of Leopold, whose members \nconcerned themselves with finding and destroying perceived supernatural threats to the \nChurch. The Society of Leopold refined its methods throughout the rest of the 13th \ncentury, and by 1300, it had succeeded in destroying hundreds of Cainites across Europe, \nparticularly in and around Spain, where the Inquisition had been founded. Most heavily \naffected were the Spanish Brujah, Lasombra and Ventrue, and more neonates than elders \n(although more than a few elders owed their ends to the Society of Leopold, as well). \nThe elders’ reaction to this new threat was to continue the time-honored \ntradition of using their childer as cannon fodder. Most elders went into hiding, \nleaving their progeny to deal with (or be destroyed by) the hunters on their own. \nSome even helped lead the zealous Dominicans to the havens of their childer, in the \nhopes that throwing some bait to the enemy might slow its pursuit. In the short term, \nthis strategy did help to divert attention from the elders’ own whereabouts, but it also \ncreated great animosity between the neonates of Spain and the elders who had taken \nadvantage of them. In addition, the neonates proved themselves far more resourceful \nin combating the hunters than their elders had expected, aiding each other when \nTHE ANARCH \nG~IDE \n14 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nnecessary and sending emissaries to other parts of Europe requesting aid against the \nInquisitors. The eventual denial of these requests by princes and elders afraid of \nbecoming targets by association served to increase the neonates’ resentment. \nLike so many events in the history of the Kindred, the spark that ignited what was \nto become the Anarch Revolt came not from a Cainite, but from a mortal. In 138 1, the \npeasant Wat Tyler led a revolt of his fellow peasants against local British nobility. The \nrevolutionaries killed the Archbishop of Canterbury and held London for a short while, \nforcing the king to fulfill some of their demands. The king’s agents captured Tyler’s \nlover, Patricia of Bolingbroke, and she was promptly sentenced to death. While she was \nin prison, she met Robin Leeland, a Brujah of some repute, who Embraced her and \naccepted her pledge to fight for justice for all eternity. Taking the last name Tyler after \nher now fallen lover, Patricia escaped and gathered like-minded individuals (mortal \nand Cainite alike) to attack the English nobility in his name. Once she finally realized \nthe futility of this pursuit, Tyler left England for Spain, where she came into contact \nwith a Ventrue elder called Hardestadt, the originator of the idea of the Camarilla. \nAs she learned of Hardestadt’s plans, Patricia found herself hard pressed to see \na difference between an organization of elders banding together for mutual protec- \ntion and the nobles who had destroyed her family and everyone she once loved. She \nexpressed her distaste for the idea quite forcefully- by leading a large coterie of like- \nminded Brujah and Lasombra neonates in an assault on Hardestadt’s castle. Although \nthe group suffered numerous casualties, Tyler herself was able to reach the incredu- \nlous Hardestadt, destroy him and devour his soul. \nWhen word of her victory reached other Spanish Brujah neonates, they erupted \nin a frenzy against the elders who had betrayed them and refused to come to their aid \nin times past. No declaration of war was necessary and no banners were flown. Young \nSpanish Brujah decided as a group that they’d had enough of being manipulated and \nundervalued by the elders who, under the Lextalionis they claimed to value so much, \nshould be responsible for helping to protect them. In some ways, this uprising \nresembled a mass frenzy among the younger generations of the Brujah; with little or \nno warning, they tumed violently upon their elders, thirsty not for potent vitae, but \nfor the freedom and equality they had so long been denied. The revolutionaries began \nusing the term anarch to describe themselves, as a symbol of their contempt for \ntraditional elder dominance over childer. After overcoming the initial shock, the \nelders naturally fought back, and the blood of old and young Cainites alike ran freely \nthrough the streets of Spain. \nMuch of this blood belonged to the ancillae, who were generally weaker and \nmore accessible than the elders sought by the anarchs. A few ancillae did join the \nAnarch Revolt, most often in the hope of gaining greater power, but the majority \nremained in the service of their sires. Those who did became the first lines of defense \nagainst the onslaught of anarchs, which - \nafter the loss of their neonate servants to \nthe anarch cause - \nsuited the elders perfectly. \nEspecially considering its final outcome, the Anarch Revolt is sometimes \noverlooked by modem students of Cainite history as a failed attempt to establish a \nnew social order. The Revolt was itself a great breakthrough, however, in the social \nCHAFER ONE: HIVORY IN ASHES \n15 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\norder of the undead, as the first time since the slaying of the Second Generation that \na large group of Kindred joined together to liberate themselves from the tyranny of \ntheir elders, rather than simply to diablerize a specific elder. Part of the anarchs’ \nsuccess stemmed from the elders’ great surprise - \nupon first hearing of the revolt, \nmany elders were at first unwilling to believe the story. Many were vain enough that \nthey only began to realize the extent of the threat once the anarchs had broken down \ntheir doors and were coming at their throats. Far more than a small band of diablerists, \nthe anarchs were a group of Cainites devoted to changing Kindred society for the \nbetter. Although the initial attacks might have been motivated by pure revenge, the \nanarchs were drawn ever closer by their commitment to creating a Cainite power \nstructure in which they could be secure. If the elders would only respond to deadly \nforce, though, the anarchs were prepared to deliver it. \nSome modem conspiracy theorists point to the simultaneous frenzy of several \ngenerations of Brujah as an indication that the Anarch Revolt was simply a move in \nthe plans of some elder hoping to eliminate rivals. If this were true, it could very well \nbe one of the greatest ruses in Kindred history - \nto trick the neonates of an entire clan \ninto attacking their elders, and even further, to believe it was their own idea and not \none planted in their minds. With few exceptions, however, the few who subscribe to \nthis theory count themselves among the Clan of the Moon, as only an “enlightened” \nmind can grasp the subtleties of such a vast and effective move in the Jyhad. Most \nKindred agree, however, that the Brujah were reacting instinctively to the centuries of \nneglect they had suffered at the hands of their sires. Even if the designs of a Methuselah \nwere somehow involved, without the rage and indignation of the Brujah who would \nbecome anarchs, such a plan could not have had even a chance of success. \nDespite their enthusiasm, rage, and craftiness, however, the anarchs soon found \nthemselves at a distinct disadvantage. Once the element of surprise had been \nexhausted, the anarchsfaced an enemy that was, on the whole, far more experienced, \npowerful and resourceful than they. After the preparations most elders had taken to \nguard against the Society of Leopold, those few whose havens were even accessible \nhad dizzying arrays of servants, ghouls, childer, traps and other deterrents to potential \nenemies - \nnot to mention the powers at the disposal of the elders themselves. \nThe anarchs also quickly learned to their dismay that enthusiasm and spirit are \nno substitute for a central organization and a communications network; too often, \nthey allowed old rivalries to resurface among themselves rather than devoting \nthemselves fully to their stated cause. At this point, only a few Cainites of other clans \njoined the Brujah in their revolt, as most considered it a problem of the Brujah clan \nalone, rather than as the general social uprising it was. As a result, the revolt did not \nextend much beyond the borders of Spain for most of the 14th century. As the \nconflict dragged on, anarchs found themselves fighting against servants several steps \nremoved from the elders they sought, which was just the type of conflict that the \nelders knew they could eventually win. \nDespite the slowing success of the anarchs, news of their effort spread quickly \nthrough the Kindred courts of Europe. In their havens and salons, Cainites of all clans \nbegan to discuss an idea that might have been considered a breach of the Traditions \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n16 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\na century before - \nthat the anarchs might be justified in demanding the right to \ndecide their own fate. Naturally, younger Cainites were most receptive to the idea. \nSome felt that all Cainites should unite to combat the common threat of the \nInquisition, while others saw the Inquisition as an opportunity to demand greater \nfreedom in exchange for aiding the elders. Notions of greater freedom varied from \nCainite to Cainite, from freedom to Embrace or to choose one’s own victims to \ncomplete independence from elder control, but many of the anarchs’ ideas found \nreceptive audiences in neonates outside of Spain. \nThe response among elders was much the opposite. Nearly all of them agreed that \nnow was the time to tighten their grip on their childer, so as to prevent a repeat ‘of the \n“Spanish disaster.” The Lextalionis would be enforced, whether or not some violent \nneonates had gotten it into their heads that they could change the world. Amazed and \nfearful at the outcome of the Anarch Revolt in Spain, many elders began to examine \ntheir childer for any signs of possible revolt, keeping them under an ever more watchful \neye. Those who still supported the creation of the Camarilla used Spain as an example \nofwhat could happen to elders who remained disorganized in the face of this new threat. \nMany elders were still unwilling to accept that any group of neonates could truly be \nenough of a threat to be worth sharing power even with other elders. As the revolt grew, \nhowever, the idea of mutual protection became more and more attractive to elders who \nfeared they might be the next targets of the anarchs’ rage. \nTHE KEEPERS \nFor the most part, Lasombra elders were among the most controlling of their \nchilder with regard to the anarchs; many prohibited their childer from meeting ‘other \nCainites or even leaving their havens without permission. But one Lasombra elder - \nGratiano de Veronese, reputedly the last childe of the Lasombra antediluvian -- \nsaw \nin the anarchs an opportunity to accomplish the goals he had harbored for the two \ncenturies since his Embrace. Around the year 1400, Gratiano began secretly aiding the \nAnarch Movement, offering his advice on organizing the sometimes fractious anarchs \ninto a more streamlined fighting force, and helping to identify the Movement’s major \nleaders. In addition, he spread the anarchs’ message to the Lasombra neonates of Italy. \nMost importantly, however, Gratiano took it upon himself to travel to the Holy Land, \nwhere he made contact with the Assamites on the anarchs’ behalf. \nCHAIER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHES \n17 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Assamites had been traveling across Europe for some time now, committing \ndiablerie in accordance with their religious beliefs. For the most part, though, they \nhad failed to locate many elders in Spain, since the battles between elder and anarch \nhad driven most of the elders into hiding. The Assamites needed help finding elders, \nwhich the Brujah could provide, and the Brujah needed the Assamites’ help as scouts, \nadvisors and sorcerers. The Assamites’ talents for stealth helped the Bruj ah to find \nand enter previously impenetrable elder havens, and in return, the Assamites \nreceived the Amaranth they desired. The tide of the revolt slowly began to turn \nagainst the Spanish elders. \nAt the same time, Gratiano’s efforts at spreading the anarch message to neonates \nin Italy came to fruition. In 1446, Lasombra neonates and ancillae gathered in \nVerona, where they resolved to start their own revolt in Italy. Although he did not \nattend the meeting, Gratiano’s campaign of confusion and misinformation among \nItalian elders helped to ensure that they were even less prepared for initial anarch \nattacks than the elders of Spain had been. For the next 35 years, the anarchs’ attacks \nraged virtually unchecked throughout Italy. \nIn about 1483, Gratiano led many Brujah, Lasombra and Assamite anarchs in \nan attack on the Lasombra Antediluvian’s haven in Sicily. Both the anarchs and the \nAncient’s servants suffered heavy losses, but eventually the five surviving anarchs, \nGratiano among them, succeeded in reaching the haven’s inner sanctum. Once \nthere, they drained the creature dry - \nand, at least by some accounts, diablerized it \nas well. When news of the anarchs’ victory spread to other Lasombraelders, many lost \ntheir will to fight; those who did not disappear eventually joined the anarch cause out \nof simple necessity. Rather than assuming leadership of the clan, Gratiano declared \nthat the Lasombra would now choose their leaders based on merit rather than age or \ngeneration. Unfortunately, most Lasombra anarchs became so involved in arguing \nand fighting over what this new merit system would be that their involvement with \nthe Anarch Movement all but ceased. Not until the creation of the Sabbat would \nthese Lasombra again leave their mark on Kindred society. \nTHE BOND \nBREAKERS \nThe Tzimisce of Eastern Europe may not have had to worry about the Inquisition, \nbut beset as they were by multiple invading forces, this was small consolation at best. \nBetween the Germans on the west, the Mongols on the east, the Turks on the south \nand the Teutonic Knights on the north, it seemed at this point that the entire mortal \nworld wanted a piece of the clan’s ancestral lands. Even worse, the Tzimisce also found \nthemselves at war with the Tremere, determined to stamp out koldunic sorcery to \npreserve their perceived monopoly on blood magic. Like the Spanish Brujah before \nthem, the Tzimisce took the easy way out - \nsacrificing their childer while slinking off \nto hide in well-guarded castles and fortresses to plan their next move. \nBut thanks to the Tzimisce neonates Velya and Lugoj (later known as Blood- \nbreaker), this situation soon swung in the neonates’ favor. The two discovered the \nkoldunic ritual that could break the blood bonds holding so many neonates in thrall - \nthe same ritual that would later become the Vaulderie after the formation of the Sabbat. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n18 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBy mixing the blood of several neonates, a blood bond could be replaced by a loyalty to \nthe group whose blood was used. The secret of the Vaulderie spread quickly among the \nyounger Fiends, many ofwhom soon discovered that without the false loyalty of the blood \nbond, they hated their sires passionately. Inspired by the example of the Spanish Erujah, \nthey decided to rise up, overthrow their sires and end this oppression permanently. \nAlthough a few Tzimisce neonates remained with their masters out of genuine \nloyalty, the vast majority joined Lugoj Bloodebreaker in his call for the elders’ blood. \nThe offensive began in 1459, and with their personal knowledge of many of the \nelders’ havens, the Tzimisce anarchs often found themselves successful where even \nthe Tremere had failed. Beyond their devotion to mutual security and freedotn, the \nyoung Fiends found themselves growing ever closer through the Vaulderie as well. As \na result, their organization far surpassed that of the elder Fiends, who were still too \nproud to trust each other. Like the Lasombra of Italy, the young Tzimisce used a \nconvert-or-die approach toward their elders, with a surprising degree of success. \nThe final blow to the elders’ morale came when Lugoj and his coterie, also \nfollowing the Lasombra’s example, invaded the haven of the Tzimisce Antediluvian. \nLugoj claimed the right to diablerize the Ancient himself, taking its power for his \nown, and in recognition of the freedom he had helped so many anarchs to reach, the \nothers allowed him to do so. Lugoj then sank into torpor, as did the resolve of the \nremaining independent elders of clan Tzimisce. The anarchs soon found that the \nencroaching forces were too much for even them to handle, and most decided to head \nwest into Central and Western Europe. \nTHF RFVOLT \nUpon reaching Eastern Europe, the Tzimisce anarchs proved to be the deciding \nfactor in spreading the anarch revolt beyond the boundaries of Spain and Italy. The \nrevolt in Spain had been underway for over acentury, and in Italy nearly as long:, with \nboth areas suffering heavy casualties. The arrival of the Fiends with the secret of the \nVaulderie upset what fragile balance remained between neonates and elders in other \nEuropean countries. Anxious to be free of their blood bonds, neonates and arcillae \nof every clan flocked to the anarch cause, eagerly trading a pledge of loyalty to the \nAnarch Movement for freedom from their elders’ control. \nIn the confusion that ensued, clan boundaries between the anarchs were often \nforgotten in the battle to destroy local elders. A few elders successfully negotiated \npeace terms with isolated anarch groups, but many of these soon found that other \nanarchs did not know about or respect such agreements. The lines between anarch \nand loyal childe also became blurred, often because of elders’ fear of destruction - \nsome childer found themselves thrown out of the haven of a sire to whom they were \ncompletely loyal, simply because of their generation. Such displaced Cainites often \nadded to the ranks of the anarch cause, for protection if not out of genuine agreement. \nTHE CHURCHSTRIKFC~RACK \nIf the elders who had survived this long through the Anarch Revolt had learned \none thing from the conflict, it was never to underestimate their childer. Unfortu- \nCHAPTER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHB \n19 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nnately, most allowed their conceits about mortals to prevent them from extending \nthis lesson to the Inquisition, and the anarchs made the same mistake. As the Revolt \nintensified, both sides became increasingly sloppy about hiding the conflict from the \nmortals around them. This was particularly true for clans Toreador and Lasombra, \nwhose power bases were concentrated partly in the Church, and as a result were \nalready closer to the Inquisition’s view than most clans. \nAs evidence of supernatural threats to the Church increased, several members \nof the Society of Leopold petitioned Pope Innocent VI11 for greater support. The \nPope responded in 1484 by making witches the official concern of the Inquisition. \nHe also increased the resources at the Inquisition’s disposal and appointed the first \nInquisitor-General to oversee the organization’s new goal. The renewed Society of \nLeopold successfully destroyed scores of vampires across Europe. Although the \nInquisition was unaware of distinctions between elder and anarch, more anarchs \nsuffered from its notice because the elders were generally much more experienced at \nhiding themselves. This became increasingly true as Toreador and Ventrue elders \nestablished contacts within the Inquisition and enjoyed some success at directing it. \nTHF FOUNDING \nOF THF CAMARILLA \nTHF FLDFRS \nUNITE \nThroughout the Revolt, a group of Cainites led by a Ventrue calling himself \nHardestadt (strange in itself, since the original Hardestadt had been slain by Tyler nearly \na century before) continued to advocate the formation of a large organization of \n“Kindred” who would work together to crush the anarchs. After the Lasombra neonates \nrevolted in 1446, many elders agreed to limited cooperation, sharing resources, informa- \ntion and childer for attacks against anarchs and Assamites. However, in 1486 Hardestadt \nconvinced the leaders of the major European clans to take their cooperation one step \nfurther by sending representatives to a formal meeting inVienna. This was the beginning \nof the Camarilla, and the beginning of the end for the Anarch Revolt. \nThe formation of the Camarilla removed the one advantage the anarchs had left \n-despite their relative disorganization, their conviction had thus far helped to unite \nthem and make them more effective than the elders. With elders beginning to work \nclosely together, though, the anarchs found themselves up against an enemy not only \nolder, wiser, and more experienced, but also far better organized. Between the agents \nof the Inquisition and those of the new Camarilla, the anarchs were outnumbered, \noutmaneuvered, and outclassed. By 1493, only seven years after the formation of the \nCamarilla, numerous anarch leaders met with Hardestadt to discuss terms of peace. \nWhile some anarchs considered this a betrayal of the cause, these leaders felt it was \nbetter tonegotiate while they still had some power, rather than being forced to accept \nfar less favorable terms after a decisive defeat somewhere down the line. \nLeaders from both sides met in the Abbey of the Sacred Crown near the small \nEnglish village of Thorns, where they drafted what came to be known as the \nConvention of Thorns. In fact, the Camarilla representatives drafted the document \nand the anarchs were lucky to get a few concessions. Under the Convention, the \n+\nI\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n20 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPTER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHES \n21 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-4 \nanarchs would return to their former places as subjects of their elders, and in return \nall but “the most heinous of crimes” committed during the revolt would be forgiven. \nThe Assamites would also be prevented from drinking the blood of other Cainites \nthrough a magical curse. As a whole, the Convention was less like a peace agreement \nthan a set of terms for surrender, but most of the anarchs accepted it, particularly the \nBrujah, who had suffered the greatest losses. \nThe Assamites, who had also suffered heavily during the revolt, declined the offer \nto j oin the Camarilla. The Founders attempted to pressure them into joining by torturing \none of the six captive Assamite elders to death on the spot, as an example of what would \nbefall the other five if the Assamites did not join. The Assamite representative agreed that \nthis would be unfortunate, but refused to change his clan’s position, offering areasonable \nransom for the elders. Realizing they could not force the point any further, the Founders \naccepted the ransom, and the Tremere laid the now infamous curse on the Assamites that \nmade the vitae of other Cainites poisonous to them. The Assamites returned to their own \nlands defeated but with their sovereignty intact. \nWhile most of the anarchs agreed that the Convention of Thorns was a \nnecessary concession, many - \nparticularly those of the Lasombra and Tzimisce clans \n-vehemently disagreed. The leader of the Lasombra delegation spoke for all of them \nwhen, after reading the first draft, she denounced it and the elders who had written \nit, declaring eternal war on them in the name of those who stood with her. Those of \nother clans who left the Convention with her were to become the antimibu of the \nSabbat, whose first act of defiance toward the Camarilla was to destroy the nearby \nvillage of Silchester and slaughter all its inhabitants. \nWhatever else might be said about the Convention of Thorns, it did accomplish \nits stated goal of bringing peace to the Kindred of Europe. After the rampant slaughter \nof more Kindred than any other single time in history, both sides were thankful for \nthat fact. Kindred historians have estimated that the majority of European vampires \nactive in 1381 had met their ends by 1493. The Camarilla took advantage of this \nthinning of the ranks by only allowing loyal elders to sire neonates, while former \nelders rarely received permission from their princes. Over the next few centuries, the \nvisible anarch presence in Europe all but disappeared, and Camarilla members came \nto believe the Movement would never again threaten the established order. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n22 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPTER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHES \n23 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nREVOLUTION’S ASHES \nUpon first glance after the conclusion of the Convention of Thorns, the Anarch \nRevolt had been a dismal failure. Many anarchs considered the devastation of the \nlands they had loved, the destruction of their comrades and the lesson of the futility \nof rebellion to be the only things gained from their struggle. Not one word of the \nLextalionis had been altered, and young Kindred had no more say in clan or sect \naffairs than before. Many questioned whether the centuries of struggle and all the \nFinal Deaths of their comrades had been in vain. \nWhat these unhappy souls failed to realize was that although they had failed in \ntheir stated goal of reforming Kindred society, they had nonetheless succeeded at \ntransforming themselves and those around them. The anarchs’ show of strength, \nwhile ultimately unsuccessful, had opened the eyes of Cainite elders to the true \npotency of their childer and taught these elders something to which many of them \nwere unaccustomed: fear. Before the revolt, few elders questioned that their domi- \nnance over their childer was the natural way of Cainites. Now, some began to \nquestion the “better to be feared than loved” approach. Some elders grew more \ndevious as a result, learning to subtly maneuver their childer toward affection for \nthem rather than controlling them with an iron hand. Regardless, all elders were now \npainfully aware that should they cross the line between forcefulness and cruelty, their \nchilder were fully capable of seeing that they paid for it in blood. \nFor their part, the anarchs had learned several valuable lessons as well. The first \nwas that any elder - \nindeed, even an Antediluvian - \nwas no match for a large \nenough and strong enough group of vampires willing to sacrifice anything and \neverything to achieve its goal. For agroup of Kindred who had been taught - \nin some \ncases, had been practically brainwashed into believing - \nthat their elders were \nbeings of nearly godlike power and influence, this was a substantial revelation, and \nit meant that eternal servitude was no longer inevitable, whatever the Convention \nof Thorns might say. Hand in hand with this realization was the new knowledge that \nthe myth of the relationship between elder and neonate was nothing more than that. \nWhether the Lextalionis was truly handed down from Caine or created by some elder \nin the past, its reach extended only to those who chose to subscribe to it. \nAlmost two centuries before Enlightenment philosophes such as Locke and \nRousseau proposed similar ideas, anarch philosophers had developed the concept of \nlibertas - \nthe free will with which all Kindred are endowed, regardless of age or \ngeneration. Kindred historians point to this as one of the few episodes in history \nwhere the Kindred anticipated mortal trends rather than following them. Anarchs \ntaught their childer that libertas was important above all things, and most impor- \ntantly, that attempts to deprive a Kindred of libertas should be treated just as seriously \nas attempts to deprive him ofpossessions or ofunlife itself. Even (and especially) after \nthey had forcibly rejoined the Camarilla, anarchs passed on the legacy of libertas and \nthe vision of a society of equal Kindred to their childer and grandchilder, in the hope \nthat it might still come to exist someday. \nThe final and most tangible effect of the Anarch Revolt is one that most anarchs \nwho know of it desperately wish they could forget - \nthe creation of the two great \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n24 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsects, the Camarilla and the Sabbat. In the global scheme of things, the fact that the \nanarchs forced formerly xenophobic elders to cooperate with each other might be \nseen as a significant evolutionary step, but naturally, most anarchs are hard-pressed \nto see it that way. As if that weren’t bad enough, the few anarchs with the backbone \nto stand up for their convictions at the Convention of Thorns perverted those \nconvictions to create the Sabbat, whose rigid structure and group blood bonding \npractices also run counter to everything true anarchs stood for. Enforced, artificial \nloyalty to a group rather than to an individual doesn’t make that loyalty any less \nartificial or mandatory. \nAccording to some modem Kindred students of history, later revolts of the \nanarchs against their elders might have been avoided if the elders had simply been \nwilling to share a small amount of power with their childer. If the Camarilla had been \nless concerned with saving face and more concerned with creating a truly maintain- \nable peace, the terms of the Convention might have given the anarchs enough \nfreedom and power that the Sabbat would not exist today. Instead, by returning the \nanarchs to the same situation against which they had originally rebelled, the elders \nensured that the same resentment and discontent that fueled the Anarch .Revolt \nwould remain to erupt later in unexpected ways. \nTIMF \nMARCHFS \nONWARD \nTHE FRENCH \nREVOLUTION \nFor nearly three centuries, the Camarilla’s claim of domain in Europe lay \nunchallenged. Many anarchs traveled to the American colonies to escape their elders’ \ninfluence, and by and large the elders were glad to be rid of them. Most elders considered \nthe colonies beneath their notice, and the anarchs traveling there doubly so, and were \nglad to once again claim dominion over Europe. Even if their confidence in their own \ninfallibility had been badly shaken, at least they didn’t have to worry about slavering \nanarch bands breaking down their doors and murdering them in their havens. \nAt least, not until 1789. However unconcerned the elders may have been about \nthe colonies, the anarchs of Europe had been greatly affected by the American \nRevolution. In the political statements of the mortal political philosophers I’aine, \nAdams, Jefferson, and Franklin-as well as Locke, Rousseau, and the others who had \ninspired them - \nthe anarchs found a great deal that resonated with their own \npolitical vision. When the mortals of France, stirred by events across the Atlantic, \nbegan to grumble about their treatment at the hands of King Louis XVI and his \nnobles, a number ofprominent anarchs secretly urged them on. Among the peasants \nwho stormed the Bastille in July 1789 were a number of Kindred expressing their \ndistaste for the traditional Toreador dominion of France and who saw the grc’wing \nrevolution as their chance to strike back. They knew they had little chance of success \nalone, but with the mortals whose cause they shared, they were able to xrike \ndecisively against the Toreador power base in France. Unlike the elders’ often cruel \nand self-serving use of mortals to further their own ends, the anarchs joined wit11 the \nFrench revolutionaries out of a real sense of kinship and identification with their \nCHAPERONE: \nHISTORY \nIN ASHE \n25 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngoals. Whatever their faults, the anarchs saw the French peasants as people, rather \nthan simply as pawns or food. \nEcstatic at the success of the revolution, the anarchs quickly began making plans \nto spread it to other countries. Their mortal allies proved less than faithful, however. \nThe National Convention, which had been founded to rule France after the \nexecution of Louis, dissolved into wrangling committees, which gave the Toreador \nand Ventrue elders a chance to shift the balance of power once again. They plotted \nthe overthrow of the convention through their own agents and allies, installing a \nFrench general named Bonaparte as the head of the government in 1799. Eventually \nnaming himself Emperor of France, Bonaparte quickly extinguished the egalitarian \nreforms of the revolution, and the Toreador regained their place as the dominant \nKindred in France soon thereafter. Despite this defeat, however, the revolution once \nagain showed the Camarilla that even after long periods of apparent dormancy, the \nanarchs would always stand ready to fight for the cause of freedom. Still, more than \n150 years would pass before a similar outbreak occurred again. \nTHF VICTORIAN \nAGE \nThe late 18‘h and early 19‘h centuries saw the growth of a literary movement \nknown as Romanticism, which emphasized mystery, the supernatural, and strong \nemotions such as love, hatred and horror over the strict rationalist teachings of the \nprevious century. Along with this came a new idealism, expressed in the develop- \nment of several types of socialism - \nboth the revolutionary form, exemplified by the \nwritings of Karl Marx, and the less radical utopian branch, which advocated the \ncreation of small, self-sufficient socialist communities. In the year 1848, a number of \nrevolutions broke out across Europe; although most of these uprisings eventually \nended in failure, some revolts continued, eventually leading to the creation ofunified \nGerman and Italian states. Although some anarchs were no doubt involved with \nboth, the true ray of hope for the anarchs in this century came at its end with the \nblossoming of the Victorian Age. \nIt was also a time in which civility and decorum reigned supreme; a gentleman’s \nname was everything to him, and some princes who wished to seem benevolent even \nappointed anarch liaisons “for the good of all Kindred.” Anarchs found themselves able \nto discuss their beliefs in the salons and balls of polite Kindred society, so long as they \nbehaved themselves, and some Kindred came to see the light of reform. Elected princes, \nonce unheard-of, became an occasional occurrence thanks to the prevalence of anarch \nideas, and some princes (elected and otherwise) even relaxed the Traditions. Some \nallowed all members of the domain to Embrace once a year without obtaining explicit \npermission, while others instituted personal Domains for all prominent Kindred or \nrelaxed the Tradition of Hospitality to apply only to Elysium. \nIndeed, it seemed for a short while that the dream of the anarchs might become \na reality, and members active during the era still speak of it as a time of promise, when \nanything might have come to pass. But however great the strides made then might \nhave seemed, the Camarilla was still run by Kindred, with a Beast lurking deep in \ntheir hearts. Those few notable reforms of the Victorian Age to survive the alarm and \n+- \nI \nTHE ANARCH blDE \n26 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nreactionary backlash that accompanied the publication of Bram Stoker’s D’racula \ndied aquickdeath with the coming of the Great War. Anarch resentment at this new \nfailure grew, and many decided (like those before them) to try creating their utopian \nstate in the New World. It would take over half a century to begin the groundwork \nfor another period of upheaval. \nA DRFAM \nDFFFRRFD \nTHE ANARCH \nFREE \n5TATF \nWith the restoration of Toreador dominance in France, many anarchs left for \nAmerica, which was still relatively free of Camarilla influence at this point; following \nthe end of the Victorianera, more anarchs did the same. Many of the Camarilla elders \nconsidered America a trackless wasteland, and in keeping with old tradition some \neven considered it a useful “dumping ground” for disgruntled Cainites. The Sabbat \nhad a presence in America, but internal dissension had interfered with its efforts to \ngain a foothold in the New World. \nDespite this power vacuum, however, the anarchs failed to create any large-scale \ndomains for themselves in the Americas. Some Camarilla Kindred have used this to \njustify their opinion that the anarchs are ineffectual without the Camarilla to react \nto. In response, anarch scholars are quick to point out that most of the anarchj who \narrived in America were on the run from the princes and archons of the Camarilla, \nhad no idea whom they could trust, and certainly had no central organization to \nconsult for help. On the whole, they were only interested in finding a quiet hunting \nground and lying low. \nOf course, the Camarilla eventually came to America, and in typical fashion, it \nquickly and systematically claimed domains across the East Coast. The confrontations \nthat resulted between the resident anarchs of a city and the better-organized Camarilla \nmembers rarely came to violence. Rather, as a city became more important and better \npopulated, the anarchs dwelling there would suddenly find their former hunting \ngrounds occupied by a prince and his court. The usurpers would politely point out that \nthis was now a Camarilla city and perhaps the anarch would find better hunting to the \nwest. Though slow, this process of displacement was constant and unavoidable. By \n1900, a number of anarchs found themselves on the West Coast, particularly in San \nFrancisco and the small town that would become known as Los Angeles. \nIn 1900, Los Angeles was already beginning to experience the almost miraculous \ngrowth that would turn it from a tiny town of about 10,000 into one of the largest cities \nin the world within less than a century. The Camarilla recognized that it needed to \ncreate a presence in this potentially important city, and in 1924, its council rn,ad.de a \nformer Spanish alcalde named Don Sebastian Juan Dominguez prince of the City of \nAngels on the condition that he would “do something about the anarch problem.” \nUnfortunately for those who chose him, they had badly misjudged the new \nprince of Los Angeles. Don Sebastian was a vain, indolent creature whose idea of \nsociety was to surround himself with effete Toreadors like himself and let everyone \nelse do mainly as they pleased. This suited the anarchs very well, since they finally \nCHAPTER ONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHE \n21 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhad a city where the prince didn’t seem to care what they did, as long as they stayed \nout of his way. Anarchs from around the country made the exodus to Los Angeles and \nthe other small cities that surrounded it. \nOne of the anarchs who moved into the Los Angeles area was a Brujah named \nJeremy MacNeil. MacNeil had been Embraced in 1657, long after the Anarch Revolt, \nbut his sire, James, was part of Tyler’s initial peasant revolt in 1381, and fought on the \nanarch side in Spain and Italy. He taught Jeremy to love freedom and fight oppression, \nand Jeremy had struggled against the British overlords in Scotland, Ireland and \nAmerica. The princes of every city in the United States soon came to know and revile \nhis name, and so he eventually ended up drifting into Los Angeles in 1943. \nOnce there, MacNeil found a powder keg ready to explode. More and more anarchs \nwere moving into the area, which now boasted such anarch luminaries as Salvador \nGarcia, Marguerite Foccart and the notorious Smiling Jack. The rest of the Los Angeles \nKindred were increasingly disgusted by Don Sebastian’s capricious princedom, which had \na habit of swaying unpredictably from complete hisser faire to utter repression. The \nanarchs found this situation all too familiar. Very few of them had witnessed the Anarch \nRevolt, but most knew that the anarchs of old had rebelled against their elders and almost \nmanaged to create a society where a Kindred would be valued not for his generation or \nclan but for his individual worth. They also knew that the past anarch leaders had \nbetrayed the dream and that the Camarilla Kindred ultimately kept power for themselves. \nHere in California, the young anarchs reasoned, they finally had the opportunity to create \nthe utopia about which the first anarchs had dreamed. By living together in harmony \nwithout a prince or primogen, they would show anarchs everywhere that the time had \ncome for agloriousrevolutionagainst allwhowouldrob themoftheir liberty andfreewill. \nBy 1944, the rumblings ofdiscontent among the local Kindred had reached even \nDon Sebastian’s ears, and he knew just how to deal with the problem. He ordered \nJeremy MacNeil detained and savagely beaten, figuring that this act would kill any \ndesire to rise up on the part of these foolish revolutionaries. Salvador and many of the \nother anarchs wanted to use the incident as the rallying point for a new revolt, but \nMacNeil counseled patience and preparation. So the anarchs studied the prince and \nprimogen for six weeks, locating their havens and learning about their defenses. \nFinally, on December 21, 1944, the Second Anarch Revolt began. Just before \ndawn, parties of heavily armed anarchs attacked many of the city’s elders in their \nhavens. While not all of the attacks resulted in victories, an appreciable majority did, \nand those Kindred who managed to escape mostly fled the city as quickly as possible. \nDon Sebastian himself was slain by Salvador Garcia in a vicious combat that ended \nwith Don Sebastian’s rancho burning to the ground. \nAfter their initial successes in Los Angeles, the anarchs moved south and \n‘‘liberated)) San Diego, then moved north in the hopes of doing the same in San \nFrancisco. There, however, they were unsuccessful, as then-prince Vannevar Tho- \nmas mounted a strong defense and turned them away. Nonetheless, the anarchs had \nachieved quite a bit in three months. The Anarch Free State, as the coalition called \nitself, stretched from the Mexican border to San Jose, and there were no princes, no \nprimogens . . . no “governing” body (in the Camarilla’s sense of the word) at all within \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n28 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe region. The Revolutionary Council, which had been formed to coordinate the \nmilitary efforts of the anarchs, decided to adopt a set of principles of self-governance \nfor the Free State before dissolving itself. It created what it called the “!Status \nPerfectus,” or the “Perfect State.” \nAlthough clearly based on earlier anarch philosophies, the Status Perfectus was \na revolutionary document, the first to state the anarch dream clearly and unequivo- \ncally in modern times. It called on anarchs everywhere to care for one another \nregardless of clan affiliation and to help each other break free from the shackles of the \nLextalionis. It promised a nation free of political oppression and elder prejudice and \nswore to extend that freedom to all Kindred everywhere. \nThe immediate aftermath of the Second Anarch Revolt surprised all of the \nKindred, especially the anarchs. Rather than joining together in a glorious fellow- \nship, the Kindred of the Free State almost immediately formed themselves into \ncross-clan coteries and gangs that staked out a geographical area (which they referred \nto as a barony) and forbade anyone else to hunt there. It was almost as if, in the \nabsence of a Camarilla to create and uphold princes and domains, the anarchs had \nto re-create the same structure themselves. \nThis was a terrible philosophical blow to the anarch scholars who came to study \nthe Anarch Free State in the hopes that it would be the modem re-creation of their \nbeloved ideal. What they found instead were packs of Kindred who were frequendy - \nand often literally- at each other’s throats. Scholars argued over whether this inability \nto create a grander society was a result of the Beast that lies snarling within the breast \nofevery Kindred, or whether it was merely a transitional stage through which the Status \nPerfectus had to go on its way toward a more unified egalitarian society. \nUnfortunately, the anarchs never had the chance to find out. The Free State was \nremarkably resilient, surviving a direct attack by the Sabbat in 1965 and an enormous \ncivil war between a Kindred and a mortal gang in 1992, but ultimately proved too \nprecarious to hold during a Cathayan invasion in 1998. What eventually brouglnt an \nend to the Anarch Free State was a combination of external plotting and intmemal \ndissension. The Quincunx of the Cathayans, forced to conclude that it was not \neconomically feasible to take the Free State by force, began a divide-and-conquer \nstrategy. The invaders offered Salvador Garcia, who led the Hermandad gang, \nassistance in his ongoing battle with the Crypt’s Sons, run by Mohammed al-Muthlim. \nAlthough no one fully understands why a canny old guerrilla fighter like Salvador \nwould accept help from a group that had only recently attacked his beloved Anarch \nFree State, he did, and that was the beginning of the end for the anarch realm. \nWithin a few months, high-profile anarchs from across the domain were \naccepting positions with the Cathayan forces. The Quincunx cleverly sold them- \nselves to the weary anarchs as peace-bringers and preservers of the egalitarian dream. \nUnder the “New Promise Mandarinate,” those who were qualified would rise to \npositions of power, and the strongest would no longer prosper at the expense of the \nweak. To the anarchs, weakened from decades of internal warfare, the prospect was \nultimately too appealing to resist. By the beginning of 2000, virtually all of Los \nAngeles was the domain of the New Promise Mandarinate. \n+- \nI \nCHAPTER ONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHIS \n29 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHF FND \nOFTHF MOVFMFNT? \nKindred chroniclers with little more than basic understanding of the anarchs have \nreferred to the dissolution of the Free State as “the end of the anarchs as an organized \npolitical movement.” More learned Kindred have pointed out that some foolish \nvampires made similar comments after the First Anarch Revolt and the French \nRevolution, only to be disproved in the future. In fact, the strength of the anarchs has \noften been their relative lackoforganization; no matter how many anarchs aredefeated \nor killed, more always appear from some dark corner or concealed hideout. In the wake \nof the end of the Anarch Free State, anarchs have fanned out across the United States, \nsome even returning to Europe to spread their message. In some ways, the new Anarch \nMovement is even more dangerous than the Free State, since discontented Kindred \nhave nowhere to go now when they’ve had enough of unlife under the Camarilla. They \nmust either submit or fight on, and the anarchs know that a number of these desperately \nunhappy Kindred will choose the latter. \nDespite these new rumblings of discontent, which are now appearing through- \nout most Camarilla (and some Sabbat) cities, most elders have stopped worrying \nabout the anarchs. This indifference is symptomatic of the same flawed and largely \nwishful thinking that has plagued the elders since 1381, and likely since time \nimmemorial - \nregarding a threat as entirely gone when it disappears temporarily. \nThe anarchs are more than a simple group of like-minded Kindred with a common \ngoal; they share a dedication to freedom and the idea of libertas that will be difficult, \nif not impossible, ever to eliminate completely. \nDespite the ultimate failure of the Anarch Free State as a model for the anarchs’ \nideal society, Kindred historians and social scientists still often use the Movement \nitself as a basis for various theories. Many point to its continued existence as proof \nof the power of conviction and belief to unite people, even the undead, through the \nyears. Often, it also serves as an example of how such conviction can help maintain \nand strengthen the humnitas of those who pursue it, as strivingfor a very human goal \nlike freedom helps other human virtues to fall in line as well. For all the hardships \nthey have suffered through the long centuries, the anarchs remain the most humane \nsingle group of Kindred in the modem world, and their ideals continue to shake the \nhalls of the Camarilla and give pause to the packs of the Sabbat. Though battered and \nat times nearly broken, the anarchs still carry on; for each one that falls, another sees \nthe light of freedom and takes up the cause, and from their lips comes the cry: \nThere shall be no rest without freedom! \nTHL ANARCH &DE \n30 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPTER \nONE: HISTORY \nIN ASHD \n31 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nItisbetter todieon yourfeet thnliveon yourknees. \n- \nEmiliano Zapata \nCHARACTFR \nCRFATION \nAND TRAITS \nEach persona in Mind's Eye Theatre is an individual with his or her own tal.ents, \nskills, vampiric Disciplines, friends and foes.

The Camarilla takes pains to make sure that Kindred \nknow all men (and women) are not created equal - \nthe egalitarian ideals of the \nanarchs are not the ideals of the Camarilla, and may have caused problems that forced \nthe individual to leave the sect. The struggle against the near-mythical Antediluvians, \nquasi-religious structure, and the inhumanity of the Sabbat may have been a tum- \noff for a freethinking individual Embraced into that sect. Or perhaps the character’s \nmotive for joining is more personal, a desire to be free from a domineering sire or to \nescape certain death at the hand of one sect. \nIn short, causes to rebel against the system are endless -what \nmatters is what \nthe character considers important enough to make her throw away the relative \nsecurity and camaraderie offered by the sects and cast her lot with a relentlessly \npersecuted group. For every intelligent, politically adept revolutionary, there is a \nmindless thug who’s quick with his fists. Concepts vary immensely; there’s simply no \nsuch thing as a “proper)) anarch concept. There are only smart and foolish vampires, \nthose who survive and those who end up ashes in the wind. The Anarch Movement \nattracts Kindred from all walks of life and unlife, and while they may argue and fight \namong themselves at times, there is room for all under the broad umbrella of \nrevolutionary ideas of freedom and self-determination. One on one and as a group, \nanarchs above all are individuals. \nPERSONALITY \nARCHFTYPFS \nSomeNatures and Demeanors are more common among Anarchs, just as certain \nNatures and Demeanors are more common in the Sabbat and the Camarilla. Some \npersonality types have a special affinity for the sociopolitical causes of this group of \nvampires. Architects, Autocrats, Competitors, Judges, Pedagogues, Idealists and \nVisionaries are often drawn like moths to the flame of the Anarch Movement. \nDecades, if not centuries, of struggle against the Camarilla’s stasis and geriocracy and \nchoking under the collars of the elders’ leashes may attract Curmudgeons, Deviants, \nRebels and Rogues to the rank and file of rebellious Kindred. Bravos, Connivers, \nPerfectionists, Soldiers and Tricksters also make fine radicals because of the ways in \nwhich they are motivated and their dedication to acting on their beliefs. Conformists \nand Traditionalists may not seem like natural anarchs, but if they conform to the \nMovement’s ideals, they can make surprisingly reliable and staunch members. \nCLAN \nCertain Clans compose the majority of vampires in the Anarch Movement. Of \nall the major clans, Brujah, Malkavians, Nosferatu, Toreador and Ventrue comprise \nthe bulk of the Anarch Movement, though they are certainly not the only ones who \ndo not wish to go Autarkis or join the two major sects. \nT H F ~ R O U D  \nThe Brujah make up the majority of the social gadflies and critics, and the \npassion they bring to the cause is undeniable. Brujah fight like no other clan when \nthey struggle against a common enemy; their physical power makes them some of the \nTHE ANARCH GIDE \n36 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMovement’s strongest front line fighters when violence becomes the only option. \nDespite what the sects believe, however, only rare Brujah rise very high in the ranks \nof the anarchs - \nwhile their intense passions and supernatural charisma make them \nexcellent gang leaders and rabble rousers, their natural impulsivity and inability to \ncontrol their tempers tend to make them poor leaders in the long term. Only those \nwho have tempered their rage with experience can hope to hold on to any po5ition \nof real authority for long, and even they must endure the inevitable criesof “sell-out!” \nfrom their younger clan members. On the surface, anarch Brujah are not much \ndifferent than their Camarilla and untitribu brothers - \nthey fight a great deal among \nthemselves and cannot seem to agree on much except that change is needed. \nContrary to the expectations of many of their fellows, however, the famous Brujah \nclan loyalty is seldom much in evidence when anarch Brujah meet with their \nsectarian fellows. While some of the more enlightened members of both sides are \ncontent to confine themselves to heated philosophical and rhetorical debates, most \nmeetings between the two sides end in brutal violence. Indeed, most anarch Bivjah \nhave nothing but contempt for the “patsies” and “zealots” of the sects, seeing them \nas having betrayed their clan’s legacy of advocating change and social evolution in \nfavor of petty perks or senseless bloodshed. \nMalkavian anarchs are either stragglers or those whose voices in their heads told \nthem to stop being doormats and try to change the world. Malkavians bring a kind \nof inspired lunacy to the activities of the Anarch Cause, formulating masterful \nstrokes of sheer chaos that defy prediction and leave onlookers forever changed by \nthe experience. They are seen as visionaries and greatly valued when lucid, but their \ninherent instability makes other anarchs view them with caution. Frequently, they \nserve as firebrands and recruiters, eager to show the sects the folly of their hidebound \nways and offer others the freedom the anarch unlife provides. They are also excellent \nat what is quaintly called “Discordian effect” tactics - \ncausing chaos in ord’er to \nconfuse the enemy, sow dissension and otherwise distract from the true goals of the \nanarchs. However, they are far from the whimsical pranksters sometimes depicted by \npopular accounts; they are generally consummate guerrilla warriors, carefully choos- \ning each incident of apparently random chaos in order to generate the most possible \nmadness and confusion. In addition, they remain connected to their clan through \ntheir collective madness and as a result are good sources of information on the \nmovements of their fellows in either sect. Anarch leaders who know of this \nconnection are often equally careful not to reveal too much of their own plans to the \nLunatics for fear of such information being transmitted this way as well. \nThe Sewer Rats of the cities find themselves sought after for membership in the \nfight for resources and equal rights - \nnot only for their vast information network, \nbut for their ability to keep fighting even after suffering devastating setbacks. For \ntheir part, these individuals find attractive the ideals of equality and position based \non merit espoused by the Anarch Movement, as the Nosferatu tend to be passed over \nfor important duties because of their foul countenances and strange manners. Such \nNosferatu come to view the loose collective of independent vampires as a way to \nmake their mark and survive the coming violence; to this end, they collect the secrets \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKING \nUP THE FIGHT \n37 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof their Sabbat and Camarilla clanmates while using that knowledge to push their \nown political agenda forward. They are also powerful and cunning soldiers in times \nof conflict, masters of savage hit-and-fade attacks that leave their enemies broken \nand bleeding without a clear idea of what hit them. \nToreador also can be found in the anarchs, but contrary to popular opinion of \nthis fickle clan, those in the rank and file have not traded sect security for the struggle \nof social change on a whim. An anarch Toreador has weighed and considered his sect \naffiliation carefully or was Embraced into “the status-quo-has-got-to-go” worldview \nby a more revolutionary sire. Many have gone from posh gallery openings and \ncontracts with major publishing companies to nightly selling their art from streetside \nstands, doing beautiful graffiti murals, creating so-called “outsider art” or writing \nexplosive pieces in cleverly circulated underground literary j ournals. Other Toreador \nstill haunt the halls of high society as they once did in the role of emissaries and \ndiplomats, negotiating with the sects and otherwise providing a positive public face \nfor the Movement. Only a foolish anarch assumes that just because one of the Artistes \nhas joined the cause, she must have pulled light duty to do it. The dangers of facing \ndown elders in their own Elysium and trying to convince such reactionary creatures \nof the validity of the Cause are just as great as - \nif not greater than- \nthe hazards of \nthrowing bombs at the walls of the Ivory Tower. \nNo vampire has sacrificed so much by giving up her clan’s sect affiliation as a \nVentrue who decides to leave behind the established structure of the sects and strike \nout on her own. However, it is more common to find a Ventrue in the Movement \nthan one might expect. The clan makes a policy of Embracing the best and brightest, \npeople used to getting their own way; forcing these individuals into subservient \nconformity with the desires of a larger sect is bound to generate a lot of friction. \nLikewise, some more innovative or daring members simply see more room for \nopportunity outside the sect than in it, and are willing to join “the competition” in \nreturn for their assistance in building the world of their desires. While they must put \nup with no small amount of suspicion and derision for their supposedly “proper” \nhabits, Ventrue who prove themselves loyal to the Cause make up some of its \nstaunchest supporters. \nTHF FFW \nGangrel who have an interest in politics or libertas are also found among the \nanarchs. They bring their ferocity and fearlessness to the struggle and are wonderful \nguides through the wilderness between urban centers. Even those uninterested in the \nanarch cause will sometimes hire themselves out to perform such services for anyone \nwilling to pay their price. However, many young anarchs share the common \nmisconception that just because the Gangrel have turned their back on the \nCamarilla, that means they are interested in joining the Movement. Members are \nadvised to approach the Outlanders with caution, as even the most sympathetic of \nthem are quite territorial and don’t take kindly to pushy outsiders seeking to involve \nthem in the same political struggles they so recently abandoned. Still, if approached \ncorrectly, many Gangrel make excellent recruits, or at least allies in the fight. \nTHE ANARCH CUIDL \n38 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNo few surviving Ravnos have also sought out the Movement for the security of \nthe anonymity it offers them. However, given their previous reputation and the \nrecent tide of savagery that washed over this elusive and elliptical clan, most of their \nfellow anarchs give them a wide berth until the Ravnos inquestion proves her loyalty \nand dedication several times over. No strangers to being played by others in the past, \nas a whole the anarchs are wary of being used as another card in the monte game the \nRavnos are playing - \nor as a speed bump in the path of this clan’s many enemies. So \nwhile Ravnos can certainly find their own role to play in the Movement, it generally \ntakes a long time before their fellow anarchs truly trust them, and if lost that trust can \nprove very difficult to regain. \nBy contrast, the least common clans that still make up an appreciable percentage \nof the Movement are the Assamites, the Lasombra and the Tremere. Recruits; from \nthose three clans are typically neonates who have failed to fit in with their (clan’s \npower structure (or even just failed an important assignment and are running from \nthe consequences). Assamite anarchs are largely non-Middle Eastern in ethnic \norigin who have trouble understanding the clan’s complex history and hierarchy, or \nsometimes have met with internal prejudice from the circumstances of their Embrace \nand have become frustrated at their lack of advancement. Lasombra anarch are \nfrequently young ex-Sabbat seeking an alternative to that sect’s extremism, or \nindividuals who could never buy as gospel truth the religious and philosophical ideas \nspouted by the sect. \nLast and by far the least are the Tremere anarchs. Most are either second- \ngeneration anarchs, furtively Embraced outside the clan’s auspices, or actively \nwanted by their former Camarilla-loyal peers for one crime or another. They keep \nextremely low profiles, trying not to attract attention while still pursuing their \nsorcerous studies to the best of their limited capabilities. A rogue Tremere’s unhfe is \nusually a dangerous and lonely existence, as even among the anarchs the Warl.ocks \nare treated with grudging respect at best and open animosity at worst. An.arch \nTremere are rarely strong in Thaumaturgy, as the clan zealously hunts clown \nparticularly skilled defectors for fear they will betray clan secrets to outsiders; ‘most \nare apprentices who broke free early in their training, before the clan considered \nthem much of a threat. Even they know that the eye of the Pyramid is ever-watchful, \nhowever, and seldom relax their guard for long no matter where they are. \nThe Caitiff are used by the Sabbat and treated with caution or derision by the \nCamarilla. They do not fall into the cracks, but rally together in the modem Anarch \nMovement to right the perceived wrongs of vampiric society or seek revenge for and \nbring an end to the abuses perpetrated upon them for having a questionable pedigree \nand youth. The Clanless compose a large number of anarch vampires, nearly as many \nas the Brujah, and often take up the cause for similar reasons. Caitiffs bring first-hand \nexperience of why things need to be reformed and come from all walks of life and \nunlife. They have their own reasons for pursuing this goal in their unlives and \ncontribute in myriad ways to the fight against the Camarilla’s geriocracy and the \nSabbat’s monstrousness. \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKN \nUP THE fim \n39 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRAREST \nOF ALL \nSome clans are so uncommon as to be nearly nonexistent, even in such a \ndisparate group as the anarchs. Followers of Set are rare and even more rarely \nwelcome, as they are usually pretending to be something other than what they are, \nand tales of Setites infiltrating the Movement for their own opportunistic and \ndevious purposes abound anywhere anarchs gather. Even those who prove them- \nselves useful to the Cause are seldom trusted enough to become a part of it, and made \ninto grudging contacts at best. Sometime following the Convention of Thorns, even \na Tzimisce or a Giovanni may have supported the Anarch Cause, but they remain \nlittle more than an urban legend in the modernnights, something everyone has heard \nabout but no one has ever seen. Whether this apparent absence stems from an \ninternal mandate by these highly insular and secretive clans or simply reflects their \nnatural distrust for what the Movement represents is unknown, but regardless there \nare no known members of these clans currently active among the anarchs. \nThere are also those not of any clan who refuse to cower to the elders or hunt \nthem down to extinction. Throughout history many bloodlines of Caine have arisen, \nincluding the Salubri, Samedi, Kiasyd, Daughters of Cacophony, Gargoyles and so \non. To date, however, membership in the anarchs seems to be a highly personal \nchoice for members of these eccentric sanguinary families; the decision of one \nmember to support the Movement seems to reflect not at all on the rest of the \nbloodline. With a few exceptions (such as the persecuted Salubri and Gargoyles), \nnothing really bars a member of one of these bloodlines from joining the Anarch \nCause, but neither do they form any significant portion of the anarch population. \nSTFP \nTwo: ATTRIRUTF~ \nAttributes reflect a character’s natural capability. Each character has certain \ncharacteristics that show her intrinsic qualities and aptitudes. The character concept \nguides the selection of Attributes. A bookworm is likely to have developed more \nMental Traits than Physical Traits, while a stuntman is inclined to be physically at \nthe top of his game. When you choose your character’s Attributes, choose the priority \nof each one as well. At first, all characters are stronger in some areas than others, and \nclan and concept also shape these Attributes. Some clans are more likely to Embrace \nthe physically impressive, while others tend to recruit and Embrace social butterflies \nor scholars. If your character is a blackmailing emissary, Social Traits are more useful \nthan being a Olympic power lifter, as you’ll need brains far more than brawn to plot \nand scheme. If your character is a Brujah iconoclast who uses brute force to knock \ndown the Ivory Tower of the Camarilla, Physical Traits are likely primary, as one \ndoesn’t need a Ph.D. in aerospace engineering to kick hard and pummel. \nBuying more Traits must be reflected in the course of game. This is especially \nimportant to anarch characters, who often have limited free time to spend on non- \nessential pursuits, not to mention fewer places to hone such skills away from the watchful \neye of the sects. You cannot simply buy more Mental Traits if you do not work at \nimproving your reaction time, learning to watch your back or studying hard. Thus, a \ncharacter of average intelligence may attend night classes to justify the purchase of \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n40 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nadditional Mental Traits; by the same token, a proud and standoffish Tremere may \nblossom into a social animal once he realizes that a few well-placed words can sometimes \nbe more effective than a dozen rituals. As he works to develop better social skills, the \nplayer can purchase Social Traits to reflect that change in the character’s personality. \nSTEP \nTHRFF: \nADVANTAGF~ \nARILITIF~ \nYour character’s Abilities are the things he knows or at which he is skilled. \nAbilities can come from one’s mortal experiences or may have been learned after the \ncharacter’s Embrace (this is especially important for neonates, who likely retain more \nof the skills they used in life than a centuries-old elder). The most successful anarch \ngroups are those whose combined skills allow them to deal effectively with a wide range \nof challenges and threats. Some gangs take this idea even further, picking one or two \nareas for each member to specialize in as well as choosing a “general curriculum” with \nwhich they expect all their members to be familiar. They band together because \nindividually they cannot stand up to the Camarilla or the Sabbat, but when their talents \nare combined they have a much better chance. As per Laws of the Night, you can take \nadditional levels of an Ability to show higher proficiency in that field. \nDISCIPLINES \nYou begin play with three or four Basic Disciplines (depending on your previous \nsect affiliation, if any). You cannot take Disciplines beyond the Basic level at this \ntime. If you are Caitiff, you can choose your Basic powers from any Discipline, but \nthe Storyteller can choose to limit you to the eight most common Disciplines - \nAnimalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Potence or Presence - \nunless your character’s history makes a great case for having a more specialized \nDiscipline like Protean or Chimerstry. \nAs a rule of thumb, during character creation and beyond Storytellers should be \nslightly more lenient when permitting players to purchase out-of-clan Disciplines for \ntheir anarch characters. This is not - \nrepeat not - \nan excuse for players to min-max \ntheir Disciplines into power combinations just for the sake of having “kewl powerz”, \nbut rather a representation of the fact that anarchs are generally much more wi lling \nto teach their own Disciplines to members outside of their own clans than are their \nsect counterparts. Indeed, anarchs often use Disciplines as equalizers to compensate \nfor their lack of mundane resources or standing in Kindred society, and few anarchs \ncare about revealing hoary old “ancient clan secrets” if teaching a friend a specialized \nDiscipline means the difference between victory and defeat. \nOf course, an anarch‘s parent clan may have a different opinion on the matter \n- \ntrying to convince an enraged Tzimisce or Ravnos elder that you thought it would \nbe cool to teach your fellow gang members the secrets of the clan’s unique Discipline \nseldom works out very well. Storytellers should feel free to ensure that players who \nbecome known for teaching normally restricted Disciplines to those outside their \nclans face the appropriate consequences of that behavior. Just because you have a \nDiscipline doesn’t mean you use it in a vacuum, after all. \n+- \nI \nCHAPTER \nTWO: TAKING UP THL FIGW \n41 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBACKGROUNDS \nChoose five Backgrounds for your new character. The vampiric struggle an \nanarch experiences focuses on the connections and assets that Backgrounds repre- \nsent, but in many cases such assets are firmly in the control of the sects, necessitating \nsome conflict or manipulation to acquire (not to mention keep). As such, Back- \ngrounds require special consideration at character creation. \nCommon Ties \nAllies, Contacts and Retainers are the most common Backgrounds for anarchs, and \nthey generally need not compete with the Kindred of the Camarilla or the Cainites of \nthe Sabbat for them. These Backgrounds are most often earned through the vampire’s \nsocial prowess, hard work, street savvy or just plain charisma as opposed to things like \nvampiric lineage or social standing. Nevertheless, these are valuable tools in the \nAnarch Cause, and as long as one can provide for their specialized needs in return the \nanarch can count on invaluable and often unexpected sources of aid when battling \nenemies or staking out new territory. What’s more, since most mortals who fill the roles \nof allies and contacts are not aware of vampiric existence, sect is not an issue. In fact, \nan anarch may even have some of the same contacts and allies as a Camarilla vampire, \nthough such double-dealing carries commensurate risks should the anarch‘s connec- \ntion be exposed. However, a shared contact or rival can be a source of intelligence on \nthe enemy and that information can be used to challenge an opponent’s plans. An \nanarch who manages to successfully turn or “poach” a particularly valued agent of one \nof the sects can earn great respect in the eyes of his peers. \nUncommon Ties \nBackgrounds that represent vampiric assets are the greatest cause of conflict in \nKindred society. Herd, Generation, Influence and Resources are at the heart of the \nanarch struggle. Most young Kindred don’t have much access to these Backgrounds, \nor have only one or two levels at most, and it is a struggle to hold on to even these \nwhen the sects keep them so closely guarded. The elders keep a stranglehold on \nInfluence and like their coffers thickly lined with Resources, and don’t take kindly to \nbrash upstarts trying to take either one away from them. For their part, few anarchs \nhave the time and money required to keep a large herd under control, although many \nhave a couple of fellow outcasts and other hangers-on whom they can look to for \nready vitae. Even Generation can be a liability among those who battle the domina- \ntion of the young - \nmany younger anarchs find it hard to trust an elder, or even one \nof low generation more recently Embraced. Most of the vampires not under the \nelders’ thumbs are neonates and will mistrust anyone who shows the power and force \nof will of an elder, especially if the Kindred in question is new to the Cause. \nWith regard to Influence and Resources, many anarchs find their efforts to increase \ntheir assets beyond the most humble means viciously blocked by the sects, which in \nturn prompted many to join the anarchs to beginwith. Ifyour character has assets, make \nsure you explain how she got them, and more importantly how she holds onto them in \nthe face of adversity. Does your anarch Ventrue run a small company that might be \ntargeted for a hostile takeover if he gets too wealthy and powerful in the business world \nfor the tastes of the local primogen? Does your character have a job at the local \nt\nI \nTHE ANARCH \n&IDL \n42 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nuniversity as an associate professor that gives her some pull at that institution? \nRemember also that just because anarchs tend to have a more grueling night-to-night \nexistence, that doesn’t necessarily mean that such “gutter authority” as represented by \nSmeet or Underpuorld Influence is automatically theirs for the taking. Many Camarilla \nprinces and Sabbat archbishops keep a close eye on those sectors of the population for \njust such reasons, and employ loyal members of their own sects to watch over these areas \n-who won’t takekindly to anarch interferenceeither. It canbe tempting to think that \njust because they’re generally down-and-out and operate in some circles outside of \nrespectable sect activity, that anarchs can automatically become “outlaw princes” by \nsnatching up power in these areas of activity, but such is seldom the case. \nThus, anarchs hold tightly to their Backgrounds and cultivate more whenever \nthey can. What is gained can easily be lost as Kindred compete for a limited number \nof resources available in the community. Backgrounds can be lost as those of another \nsect poach business partners and helpful secretaries from you. Did your Nosferatu \nhave his laptop stolen and his files deleted on his desktop because he was selling the \ninformation to the enemies of the prince? With one simple theft and a press of the \nkeys, there goes his income this month. Anarchs are well aware that there is always \nsomeone more powerful and more charming than they are, and as a result become \nprotective of their connections. They keep a watchful eye on their Backgrounds \nrather than allow an elder Lick to gain those valuable links. \nSTFP \nFOUR: \nLAST TOUCHF~ \nOnce you’ve chosen concept, clan, Attributes and advantages, it’s time to put \nthe final touches to your character, including Blood Traits, Willpower Ttaits, \nMorality Traits, Virtue Traits, Merits and Flaws. \nBLOOD \nAND WILLPOWER \nTRAITS \nUse the Generation chart in Laws of the Night, p. 95, to assign the Traits \nappropriate for your anarch. Remember that Willpower Traits represent a character’s \ntrue inner strength and resolve, and so many anarchs often have high Willpower \nbecause they need that deep well of resolve to keep pushing on when all the odds are \nagainst them. Additional Willpower Traits are not a bad way to spend your Free \nTraits- it is not easy being a revolutionary, but if a character has higher Willpower, \nshe is somewhat more equipped to handle the challenges and risks she has to take to \nfight the good fight. Additionally, even neonates among the anarchs must learn \nquickly to develop self-control and to repress their Beasts in their nightly wanderings \nor face destruction, a process they often undergo with less instruction and support \nthan their sect-aligned peers. Exactly how such improvements in self-discipline \ncome about varies according to the anarch in question - \nmeditation, mental \nexercise, physical endurance and other things that test a character’s resolve are all \nvalid means of raising it. \nMORALITY \nAND VIRTUE \nTRAITS \nAssign these Traits as per Laws of the Night. It bears mentioning that anarchs are \nstill considered nominal members of the Camarilla under the Convention of Thcrns, \nCHA~ER \nTwo TAKING UP THE hctn \n43 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neven if they reject that sect’s structure and rigidity, and like their erstwhile Camarilla \ncousins the vast majority of anarchs hold to the tenets of Humanity. Even those who \ndefected from the Sabbat often did so at least in part because they were unwilling to \nabandon the last of their Humanity in the name of the sect’s goals. Those who bring \ntheir adherence to a Path of Enlightenment with them may find themselves ostracized \nor even outright condemned by their fellow anarchs unless their Path’s teachings \nnaturally complement the goals of the Movement (or at least don’t horrify the other \nanarchs too much). Indeed, given their relative youth, few anarchs follow or are even \naware of the many Paths of Enlightenment of the Sabbat, let alone the other Paths \nexclusive to clans not well represented among the anarch population. \nIndeed, though the Anarch Revolt may date back some 600 years, many \nvampires who uphold the ideals of the Cause are too young to have lost so much \nMorality. They are still feeling creatures close to the human world and the revolu- \ntionary ideals they gained from it, and many treasure that closeness as a sign of the \nrighteousness of their cause. An anarch who decides to go against this trend and \nfollow an alternative Path of Enlightenment should take time to divest himself of his \nremaining human instincts and feelings. This is best done through a personal subplot, \nin which the anarch examines his own dwindling interest in Humanity and explores \nthe alternative Paths available to him through involved, demanding roleplaying and \nsoul-searching. For example, a neonate Lasombra antirribu recruit might have \nfollowed the Path of Humanity, but along with other lessons her mentor tells her of \nthe virtues of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice. Over time, the Lasombra may \nsee the advantages her teacher has spoken of, and decide to study this alternate Path \nof Enlightenment. Slowly, the young Lasombra works to remove her rapidly dwin- \ndling Humanity, stripping away all of her mind and spirit that does not conform to \nher new code of ethics and allowing herself to become a monster. After spending \nmonths shedding the last vestiges of human nature, she is finally ready to learn to \nlisten only to her own conscience and start on the other Path. \nThis is not to say that as a rule anarchs retain more Morality than their sect \ncounterparts. Many older veterans of the struggle and those who have survived the \nwars and countless battles lose balance and devote more and more time and effort to \nthe Cause rather than to spiritual matters, their soul’s inner balance between their \nhuman origins and the Beast within becoming secondary to the mundane needs of \nthe struggle. In the process, they lose touch with their past and their beginnings. The \nexperienced vampire’s Morality withers as a result of this frustration at the status quo \nand the endless conflict against the injustices of his existence. Sadly, hardcore \nveteran anarchs often risk falling to the Beast because their rage and frustration \nerodes their Morality and leaves nothing to fill that spiritual void unless they find an \nalternate Path of Enlightenment that encourages new behavior or they allow \nthemselves to fall to Wassail. \nCreating A Revolutionary Soul \nWhen assigning your Virtue Traits, don’t forget that you’re trying to capture the \ndifferent facets of a person’s soul- in this case, a person who not only has undergone \na horrifying transformation into one of the undead, but thrown away all ties to the \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n44 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nexisting societies of her new unlife in search of something else. Don’t just put a lot \nof Traits in Courage because “it makes you immune to fear,” or load up on Conscience \nor Conviction “so I don’t have to worry about losing Morality” - \nthat may work in \ngame terms, but it creates an awfully shallow and one-dimensional character at best. \nInstead, think about why your anarch would have the Virtue Traits you assign him \n- \ndoes he have a lot of Courage because his parents died and he had to start facing \ntough decisions very young? Did she learn intense Self-control from an abusiv’e sire \nwho tormented her with the prospect of feeding on her loved ones? Or did she witness \nthe horrors of vampire society early and vowed that her Conscience would never let \nher turn a blind eye to its excesses? \nConversely, if your anarch has a low score in one or two Virtues, explain why this \nis the case - \nwas his Courage shattered after a particularly devastating defeat ,a few \nyears back, his Self-control a mess because of his unstable mental state or her \nConscience the worse for wear after a particularly brutal series of battles? Accounting \nfor your character’s Virtue Traits in this fashion not only helps define your character \nfurther, but also generates interesting backstories and insight into this new persona. \nExplain it all, and don’t be shy about pouring on the details; such are the flourishes \nof which great characters are made. \nNFGATIVF \nTRAITS \nNegative Traits bring your anarch’s personality to life and make it a more \nrealistic and believable creation. They also make a character more three-dimen- \nsional as no one, especially a vampire, is perfect. Negative Traits help develop and \nround out a character. You may take up to five Negative Traits but no more than three \ncan be in any one Attribute category. Negative Traits must be roleplayed - \nyou can \nreally act oblivious or shy or sickly when playing your character. Storytellers should \nfeel free to make players “buy off any Negative Trait they routinely ignore, since that \ncharacter has so obviously worked to overcome his handicap. As a general rule, you \nare required to portray your Negative Traits at least once per evening - \nit need not \nbe a particularly melodramatic display, but it should be something noticeable, such \nas a comment made in front of several witnesses or similar notable demonstration (at \nleast to those who know what to look for). Obviously, some Negative Traits such as \nLame may require a more continuous effort to portray -don’t hesitate to use them \nfor their full dramatic effect! \nFLAWS \nFlaws showcase specific shortcomings or problems a vampire may have. These \nare deficiencies or character weaknesses that go beyond those denoted by Negative \nTraits. As with Negative Traits, Flaws are compensated with additional Free Traits \nfor the Flawed character. Each Flaw has a point value assigned to it, ranging from one \nto seven Traits. The higher the point value, the more severe the Flaw. A character \ncan take up to sevenTraits in Flaws, subject to Storyteller approval. While characters \nare welcome to take more Flaws than that, without taking so many as to become a \nparody of a character, they receive no compensation for Flaws that go beyond the \nseven-Trait limit. Flaws are listed on page 112 of Laws of the Night. \nCHAPTER TWO: TAUNG UP THE Ficm \n45 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSome Flaws are particularly dangerous to have in the ranks of the anarchs. For \nexample, many anarch groups do not tolerate those with Infectious Bite; a Typhoid \nMary spreading disease is a liability for the Masquerade and any group of active \nanarchs. Likewise, some Flaws simply don’t fit the standard view of anarch activity \n- \nfor instance, the nomadic unlife typical of an anarch means that few can afford \nto be Territorial. It isn’t impossible to have these Flaws, just a bit unlikely - \nindeed, \nif a clever anarch can find a way to turn her Flaw into a weapon for the Cause, she \nmay earn additional respect from her peers. \nConversely, some Flaws are fairly common among anarchs. An Enemy is easily \nallowable as a Flaw, as is Notoriety, Hunted or Sire’s Resentment. However, the \nStoryteller should work to ensure that characters are taking these Flaws for valid \nreasons, and also that they reflect something more than just generally “being an \nanarch.” For instance, given their radical affiliation, many young anarchs could \nprobably take the Sire’s Resentment Flaw, so it is perfectly within the Storyteller’s \nright to demand that it reflect something more aggressive or actively detrimental in \nterms of anarch characters. Likewise, Notoriety is a commonly overused Flaw for \nanarchs - \nunless the game is taking place in a particularly repressive area (with \nsuitably dire repercussions for the one marked by this Flaw), simply being known as \nan anarch generally isn’t enough to warrant the Notoriety Flaw. The Storyteller may \nrequire the anarch who wishes to take the Notoriety Flaw to be linked - \neven if only \nby rumor and innuendo - \nto a shocking scandal, vicious attack or similar incident \nin addition to his “scandalous” anarch status. In the end, Storytellers are highly \nencouraged to decide which Flaws they want to permit in their games, especially in \ngames primarily or entirely composed of anarchs. \nDFRANGFMFNTS \nYou can also choose Derangements for your character at this time, each of which \nis worth two Free Traits. All Malkavians must have a Derangement as part of that \nclan’s innate mental instability, which is always considered “active” and for which \nthey receive no Free Traits (though they may take additional Derangements and \nreceive Free Traits for them as normal). Derangements cause unpredictable and \nuncontrollable behavior at times, and the Storyteller is justified in asking you to \nspend Experience Traits to “buy off any Derangement that is not roleplayed \nproperly. You should always work with the Storyteller before deciding to take a \nDerangement. A Derangement is not just a funny quirk, irritating tendency or \nhabitual eccentricity - \nthose are represented by Flaws, Negative Traits or just plain \nroleplaying. A Derangement represents a true, serious mental illness on the part of \nthe character, and isn’t something that can be easily dealt with or brushed aside. \nBottom line: If you can’t handle the fact that your character’s Derangement can and \nalmost certainly will make her unlife difficult and/or wreck her carefully laid plans \nat a critical moment in the future, don’t choose a Derangement. \nMore vampire-specific Derangements are listed on page 212 of Laws of the \nNight. Subject to Storyteller approval, additional Derangements are listed on page \n72 of Laws of the Hunt and page 259 of Laws of the Reckoning. \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n46 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFREE \nTRAITS \nAdd your Free Traits gained from Negative Traits, Flaws, Morality 10s:; and \nDerangements (if any) to your automatic five Free Traits granted at character \ncreation. Be mindful that you do not create an anarch who has it all - \nor if you do, \nremember that things can and will change as the chronicle goes on. As a nile of \nthumb, remember that playing a character who “has everything” is a lot less fun than \nplaying one who’s hungry for something, be it more Abilities, Influence, Disciplines \nor even the forbidden power offered by diablerie. The former character is static, just \ntrying to hang on to what she has and maintain her “perfect” state, while the other \nis dynamic, naturally aggressive and interested in making her mark on the storyline \nas she seeks out her goals. This is not to say that you shouldn’t create the concept you \ndesire -playing a character who feels as though he has it all and is desperate to avoid \nlosing it can be a great roleplaying challenge too - \nbut keep in mind that the point \nof spending Free Traits isn’t to “max out” your character, but rather to add the \nflourishes and reinforce the strengths that you feel best represents him. \nM F R I T ~  \nUse Laws of the Night as a guideline; the listing begins on page 112. Some \nMerits are particularly common to anarch characters, though by no means univmal. \nEnchanting Voice, Daredevil, Natural Leader and even perhaps a (quiet) Debt of \nGratitude or two are all natural choices, though Storytellers should keep a close eye \non those players who seek to justify more powerful Merits like Iron Willor Unbontlabk \njust “because I’m a rebel.”Many anarchs seek freedom from the sects because they are \nonly too aware of their vulnerability to supernatural bondage; taking that vulnerabil- \nity away, especially without good reason, diminishes the importance of the struggle \nrather than enhancing it. With such powerful qualities as Merits in particular, it is \nimportant to remember that they are included to enhance and expand your \nroleplaying opportunities, not create some mythical invincible uber-character \nAt the Storyteller’s option, players may select appropriate Merits (or Flaws) from \nother sources such as Laws of the Hunt. For example, the minor Merits and Flaws \nfound in Laws of the Reckoning are designed specifically to help portray the \neveryday quirks of the ordinary people who make up the imbued, but can easily be \ntaken advantage of as a source of so-called “easy Flaws” for unscrupulous players \nseeking to min-max their characters in other games. \nFree Trait costs are listed on pages 71-72 in Laws of the Night. \nSTFP \nFIVF: SPARK \nOF LIFE \nNow that you’ve created statistics, juggled books and crunched numbers to filter \nyour character concept into game terms, you must breathe life into that sheet ofpaper \nby creating a story. Don’t panic if you haven’t got a full history to accompany your \ncharacter in the first game - \nthe story may have holes that can be filled in as you \ndevelop and play your character. The holes in your history may also fill themselves \nin as you network with other characters in the game and establish connections or \ntrade stories. (More than one pair of characters has become “old friends” after a few \nCHAPTER \nTwo TAKM UP THE FIGHT \n41 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nminutes of in-character interaction, even if at the beginning of the night they didn’t \nhave a clue about each other.) Indeed, you’d be surprised how often some of the best \ndetails about a character come to you when you’re inegame and talking about your \npast - \nit’s part of the magic of Mind’s Eye Theatre, so enjoy it and have fun. \nLaws of the Night already lists a number of basic categories to consider when \nbringing a character to life (pages 72-73), and Chapter Five also contains a wealth \nof information on the anarch mindset and how to approach your character. Here are \na few more angles to consider. \nIdeals - \nWhat are you fighting for? Even if your character doesn’t consciously \nrecognize them, you as a player should take some time to come up with a coherent \npicture of what your character believes in (or holds in contempt). What political \nimpulse are you? Within that group, are you conservative, moderate or liberal? Do you \nfollow some other plan or ideology entirely? What lengths will you go to for your ideals? \nWhat lines won’t you cross? Are you evangelical about your beliefs, or do you keep them \nto yourself? Are you enthusiastic, casual, subdued or even jaded about them? What \nbeliefs do you endorse? Which ones absolutely disgust you? All these are crucial to \nplaying a believable character, as they help you react appropriately and consistently to \nin-character problems. Give them serious thought! Honestly, you won’t regret it. \nRebel Life -These \nquestions might seem mundane, but they concern the nitty- \ngritty of unlife. Though frequently overlooked, they nevertheless help create a \nbelievable character. What are your possessions?Your weapon of choice? List your gear. \nWhat do you do every night and how and where do you hunt? Where is your haven, \nif you have one? Do you live alone or with your gang? If you have no haven, how do you \nescape the sun? What is your fighting style and skill level? Do you talk your way out of \na sticky situation? Do you go looking for trouble or does it always seem to find you?How \ndo you get around: by car, on foot, by moped or plane? How do you afford nightclub \ncover charges, ammunition, your electric bill?How do people contact you? Do you have \na drop box, cell phone or use couriers to carry messages? Work with your pack to answer \nthese questions and make sure you know everything about your comrades that you \nshould - \nyour collective unlives may well depend on it one night. \nNew TRICKS \nFOR ANCIFNTDFAD \nWhile they may not enjoy the same social pull as the Camarilla or the fanatical \nrites of the Sabbat, the anarchs have been anything but idle over the past 600 years, \nand as a result have developed several unique tricks and powers to help further the \nMovement. \nANARCH \n’DISCIPLINFS \nThe anarchs have had to adapt more than perhaps any other group of vampires \nbecause they have been hunted and persecuted for so long. As a result, when the fangs \nand talons of the Camarilla or Sabbat come seeking anarch blood, they frequently \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n48 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfind surprises in store from their “upstart” foes. After all, the anarchs have learned \nover the centuries that the key to survival is flexibility. They also employ Disciplines \ntoward a different goal than their Camarilla and Sabbat peers. Modern anarchs (often \nuse their Disciplines to compensate for their lack of power and status. It may be \nfinesse, it may just be the will to survive, but they have honed their Disciplines and \nare creative, if still very careful, in using them to achieve their noble and idealistic \ngoals. One of the few things anarch and Camarilla vampires agree upon is the \nMasquerade, and cleaning up after their own messes when it is accidentally (or \nnecessarily) breached is of the utmost importance to both sides. \nPFRSPFCTIVFS \nON DISCIPLINES \nAnimalism \nTeachers for Animalism are often sought after by anarchs, though anarchs use \nthis Discipline somewhat differently than the Gangrel and Nosferatu. A nomadic \ngang favors the use of Beckoning to gather animals for feeding on them. Animals may \nnot be the best eats, but beggars can’t be choosy, and having a food source come to \nyou can mean the difference between continued unlife and Final Death for a \ndesperate anarch. Feral Whispers is often used to create a source of information from \nanimals who have eyes and ears in places an anarch cannot or will not go. Quell the \nBeast is a quick way to calm down a hot-headed Cainite about to march in with guns \nblazing when caution would be better advised, though few anarchs tolerate its use on \nthem without exceedingly good cause, as it leaves them vulnerable to outside \nmanipulation ifused carelessly. Drawing Out the Beast is most oftenused indire straits, \nwhen an anarch is about to blow her top and can’t afford to, but the Discipline can \nalso suddenly make another vampire’s human servant turn on his master or otherwise \ncreate a bit of domestic havoc. While the disturbance may be traced to the anarch \nby perceptive Kindred, said Kindred may still be forced to injure or kill a valued \nretainer in the throes of such a frenzy, making any victory over the anarch a costly \none. (After all, if one’s chauffeur suddenly goes mad while turning that tight comer, \nwho knows what might happen . . . ) Subsume the Spirit is a good way to more directly \ninfiltrate a haven or other location where infiltration in a more humanoid shape \nwould prove difficult or impossible. It is not quite as reliable as actually becoming an \nanimal, as allowed by the Protean Discipline, but it does the job almost as effectively. \nAuspex \nAnarchs most frequently use Auspex Disciplines as a means of augmenting their \noften meager security measures, or performing investigations into vampiric matters \nwhere mortal means simply aren’t adequate. Aside from their more obvious benefits, \nHeightened Senses, Aura Perception and Telepathy all have valuable uses in catching \nwind of various plots or interrogating others with improved accuracy. While many \nelders are too canny to be caught so easily by such tricks, their ghouls and other \nretainers often aren’t so vigilant, and aclever group of anarchs with these Disciplines \ncan piece together a great deal about an elder’s operations, assets and connections \neven from a series of apparently casual conversations without ever needing a face-to- \nface confrontation with the elder inquestion. It’s all in knowing where to go and what \nCHAPTER Two TAKING UP THE FIGM \n49 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nto say, and those anarchs who don’t gain some grasp of such information-gathering \nstrategies are often left far behind when it comes to vital intelligence about their \nenemies. Telepathy is also an excellent way to keep in touch with your gang when \nsilence is necessary, though the link can prove demanding to maintain when the \naction begins. As a whole, those few anarchs with the Psychic Projectioncapability use \nit largely for reconnaissance, but the danger of detection remains a potent deterrent \nto would-be spies, as do the wards and precautions surrounding many sites worth \ninvestigating in the first place. \nCelerity \nAnarchs use this Discipline largely as other Cainites do, to defend, attack and \nescape from impending trouble. Celerity is a valued Discipline to learn and is often \ntaught as part of a trade for much-needed gear or knowledge among the anarch \ncommunity. Speed is good, but also risks the Masquerade, and while sometimes there \nis no choice but to deliver a message at the speed Celerity offers, those who call too \nmuch mortal attention to themselves with their displays will earn unfavorable notice \nfrom Camarilla representatives and fellow anarchs alike. Some anarchs have also \nattempted to refine Celerity for use in sleight of hand, pickpocketing and similar fine \nmanipulation, though any great success at such specialized uses has yet to become \nwell known in the anarch community. \nChimerstry \nAs some independent Ravnos find sanctuary in the ranks of the anarchs, they \nmost often use their unique Discipline of Chimerstry to keep their foes disoriented and \nplay vital games of misdirection that draw attention away from the real goals of their \nfellows. Naturally enough, no few also use their powers of illusion to make money \nthrough confidence games, sucker bets and other feats of trickery, which can help \nendear them to local cash-strapped anarchs. However, despite the entreaties of their \nnew comrades, even the most desperate Ravnos are still often extremely reluctant to \nteach this Discipline to those outside their clan, and those few who receive such \ninstruction are cautioned to use it sparingly and not pass it on without approval from \none of the clan. Those who defy this commandment have an unnerving tendency to \nsuddenly disappear along with their students, never to be seen again . . . . \nDementation \nMalkavians are all crazy and can share that madness through Dementation. \nSimple enough, right? Well, yes and no. While many anarchs claim to value chaos \nand disruption of the routine that the sects depend on, in practice the madness and \ndisorder that this Discipline spreads is deeply unnerving to even the most hardcore \nanarchs. After all, the mind is the last true refuge of a free individual, and watching \nDementation in action proves that even that bastion is vulnerable to rot and \ncorruption. Anarchs using Dementation tend to make enemies fast if they are proven \nto be the responsible party; already viewed as mad dogs and radical lunatics by the \nstodgy and traditional-minded elders, having true lunatics among them spreading \ntheir repulsive disease makes the anarchs a genuine threat most cities will not tolerate \nfor long. That being said, the unique cosmic insights provided by Eyes ofchaos have \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n50 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nproven instrumental in many anarch plans in the past, clever applications of The \nHaunting can keep foes off guard or waste their time in useless preparations, and most \nimportantly the ability to disable one’s foes by using Passion, Voice ofMadness or even \nTotal Insanity to provoke a humiliating outburst in Elysium is apotent weapon in the \nright hands. Nonetheless, most anarchs give these vampires a wide berth, never sure \nwho the broken ones might decide to “gift” with madness next. \nDominate \nAlthough they would dearly love to turn this Discipline, one of the enemy’s ‘ most \nhated tools, against the sects themselves, most anarchs admit that it’s simply not \npossible. As the Movement is still predominantly comprised of neonates and \nthinner-blooded ancillae, their potential to use Dominate is limited to other vampires \nof high generation, making it an ineffective weapon against the elders, at least \ndirectly. However, in response the anarchs have long honed their use of Dominate \nagainst another rich class of targets - \nmortals, especially those employed by the \nenemy. Equipped with a list of names and faces, a clever and subtle wielder of \nDominate can gradually undermine an enemy’s Contacts, Allies, Retainers, Herd or \neven whole Influence Ratings through the use of repeated well-placed commands and \nsuggestions; while such deterioration can take a long time to pull off, doing so remains \none of the most powerful forms of attack at the anarchs’ disposal. Of course, this \nDiscipline also has more direct applications, such as wrenching information from a \ntarget or gaining access to areas guarded only by mortals (such as the haven when the \nmaster is away). However, many younger or more idealistic anarchs do noi: take \nkindly to uses of Conditioning or Possession, as these remove free will and the (desire \nfor self-determination from the individual so affected. These anarchs see such powers \nas a sign of cowardice, employed by elders desperate to control those around them or \nafraid to risk their own bodies, and watch fellow anarchs with these Disciplines \nclosely for signs of abuse. Last but not least, Forgetful Mind is a perpetual favorite, as \nit makes feeding and even well-executed hit-and-fade operations a whole lot easier \nto pull off without attracting undue attention. \nFortitude \nAnarchs often seek teachers for Fortitude, a useful Discipline to have when \nfacing the many enemies with whom revolutionaries are bound to clash in their \ncontentious unlives. Beyond its simple survival value, however, Fortitude is often an \nexcellent rallying point for young firebrands and gang leaders - \nparticularly bold \ndisplays of Fortitude when the odds are against the anarchs have been known to turn \nthe tide of more than one battle, not to mention helped form the basis for the \nuniquely anarch combination Discipline of Give ‘Em Hell (outlined later in this \nchapter). By contrast, many canny leaders of the Movement begin training in \nFortitude not long after assuming their positions, as they are only too aware of‘their \nexcellent value as targets for assassination or intimidation by the Sword of Caine or \nthe archons of the Camarilla. Some younger members scoff that this is the exact same \nline of reasoning that leads sect elders to hide from the world and manipulate from \nthe shadows, but if the irony of this position bothers anarch adherents of Fon:itude, \nit has yet to change their outlook on the subject. \nCHAPILRTWO: TAKING UP THL Ficm \n51 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nObfuscate \nLike F o r t i d ,  Obfuscate is considered a utilitarian “defense Discipline” in the anarch \nranks, and is frequently taught and traded by those familiar with its secrets. Naturally, for \nthosevampires who live ina sect’sdomain the increasedability to lie low that this Discipline \noffers is a true blessing, while vandals and brawlers value it for extra ease of escape in the wake \nof their misdeeds. While it is too easily pierced to have much value in long-term infiltration, \na well-timed use of Musk ofa Thousand Faces can do a lot to sow confusion, gain access to \nrestricted areas or even frame a particularly incautious or unpopular individual. Indeed, \nprovided there are no video cameras or other recording devices to put the lie to the account \nof eyewitnesses later on, Obfuscate can go a long way toward making another Kindred’s \nunlife quite uncomfortable, and more than one anarch gang has profited from the chaos \nsurrounding the indictment of a prominent sect member for some crime. Another popular \nvariant is to use Obfuscate to appear as a target and ensure that one is seen in the area of a \nvicious attack or other scandalous activity; this often works as well or better at incriminating \nmore powerful vampires in the eyes of their peers, as the implied connection established by \nthe target’s mere presence is often much harder to disprove than the commission of an actual \ncrime, especially to the naturally suspicious Kindred. \nObtenebration \nLasombra anarchs are rare in general, and even more rare are those willing to \nteach their mastery of shadows to outsiders for anything less than a truly exorbitant \nprice. As such, in the Movement this Discipline is primarily employed for its combat \napplications, although canny anarchs sometimes use its simple presence to deflect \nsuspicion onto the Sabbat when taking action in Camarilla territories. Given the \nscarcity of Lasombra anarchs, this ruse is often quite effective, though not without \nrisk - \nthe so-called “true” Lasombra of the Sabbat will often go to great lengths to \ntrack down their wayward brethren, especially those who make trouble for the sect, \nand attempt to “convert” them to the teachings of the Sword of Caine. \nPotence \nMight sometimes makes right, or at least can even the odds a little bit, and more \nthan a few young anarchs seek out Potence for the powerful edge it offers in close \ncombat. Even older anarchs still find many uses for this Discipline beyond crude \ncrushing and smashing - \nmany find that just the threat of using this Discipline is \nenough to force an opponent to submit, particularly if given a suitably impressive \ndemonstration beforehand. It is also an excellent Discipline for those who wish to be \nheard at an anarch Rave -when \nyou can clear your own path to the podium (or push \nback those who would take it from you), you can ensure that a lot more people hear \nyour message! However, those anarchs with obviously superhuman levels of strength \nare monitored closely by their more attentive comrades, simply because the Potence \nwielder can easily break the Masquerade without realizing it, not to mention draw \nunwanted attention by accidentally injuring or killing mortals in what would \nnormally be a minor confrontation for one with lesser strength. While blatant \ndisplays of Potence might impress the neonates or liven up a battlefield, wiser anarchs \nrealize that short of all-out war, this Discipline is best used subtly, a vampiric variant \nof “walk softly and carry a big stick” diplomacy. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n52 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPresence \nIt should come as no surprise that among such apassionate group as the anarchs, \nthe sheer charisma and force of will that Presence embodies makes it popular from the \nranting firebrands of the rank and file all the way up to the polished intellectuals \ndebating history and politics in the halls of the Ivory Tower. What’s more, Pwsence \nis one of the few “social” Disciplines effective against elders of lower generation, \nalthough it is best employed carefully against such canny targets unless one deliber- \nately intends to provoke their ire. Indeed, the older or more politically involved an \nanarch happens to be, the more likely she is to see beyond the immediate and thus \nmore artificial lovebate applications of Presence in favor of using more subtle \napplications to bolster her natural efforts to gain lasting allies or conneci-ions. \nSummon has a number of creative uses for those interested in setting up meetings or \neven ambushes, particularly if one can summon a target to a place he would normally \ngo anyway - \nafter all, with a large enough welcoming party, the anarchs can a1 ways \ntake their quarry elsewhere if they desire. About the only use for which nearly all \nanarchs have little love is Majesty -even most anarch leaders find its use distasteful, \ntoo reminiscent of the Camarilla’s decadent tyranny or Sabbat religious reverence. \nThey use it only sparingly, especially in regard to their comrades in the Movement. \nRevolutionary leaders known to employ Majesty against their fellow anarchs too \noften or as a means of quashing criticism of their ideas quickly find themselves \nstripped of their station and sometimes even handed over to local sect representa- \ntives, since they “so obviously belong there.” \nProtean \nThis Discipline is deservedly loved by anarchs fortunate enough to find a \nGangrel teacher who will impart its secrets. Eyes of the Beast allows the anarch to take \nadvantage of full darkness when fighting opponents, learning Earth Meld eliminates \nthe need for a temporary haven or body bag while on the road or entering hostile \nterritory, and Feral Claws gives an anarch access to powerful weaponry no mm3tter \nwhere he goes. Indeed, even the threat of the vicious damage dealt by FeralClaws has \nturned back weaker enemies in the past, and combined with any measure of Poience \nor Celerity (or both), they make an anarch truly terrifying in combat. Shape ofthe Beast \nand Mist Form allow the user to gain access to hard-to-reach locations or offer \nadditional means of escaping dangerous situations, not least because few Cainities \nexpect anarchs to possess such specialized talents. Perhaps most important to more \nidealistic members of the Movement, Protean makes its user much more self- \nsufficient, and that alone makes it a highly sought-after Discipline for those tired of \nbending the knee to the same vampiric routines. About the only problem with this \nDiscipline is availability; Gangrel willing to teach the secrets of Protean are few and \nfar between, even in the nights after their defection from the Camarilla, and even \nthose friendly to the ideals of the Movement often express great reluctance to teach \nthe secrets of this Discipline to outsiders. \nQuietus \nDespite popular rumors to the contrary, few Assamite anarchs are cold-blocded \nkillers or frenzied war machines, and their applications of their clan’s proprietary \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKING UP THE FIGHI \n53 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDiscipline reflect this. Silence of Death gives an anarch pack a clear advantage when \nthings turn violent, and is frequently used around the real target of a raid while the \nrest of an Assamite’s gang makes as much noise as possible at a different target, in \norder to further mask the use of this Discipline. Of course, Scorpion’s Touch, Baal’s \nCaress and Taste of Death all ensure that an Assamite never runs out of devastating \nkilling tools to have at her disposal. Surprisingly enough, Dagon’s Call sees the most \nuse by Assamite anarchs -while \nits value against other vampires is quite consider- \nable, its real worth comes out in blackmail and extortion against another Kindred’s \nmortal contacts. Few mortals think anything of shaking hands with a pleasant if \nslightly mysterious stranger, after all, but while the internal damage inflicted on \nvictims of this insinuative Discipline may be little more than an annoyance to the \nKindred, it can prove fatal to mortals. Even the short time the Discipline lasts \nactually works to the Assamite’s advantage, since it tends to panic a Kindred whose \nretainer is at stake and force her to make decisions before she has examined all her \noptions - \nan excellent way of keeping a normally cautious elder off balance. \nThaumaturgy \nFew anarchs have any real grasp of Thaumaturgy and those who do know it are \nmistrusted as much as if not more than their Camarillapeers. Blood is the sustenance \non which all vampires depend, after all, and those able to manipulate it with \nThaumaturgy make most Kindred more than a little uncomfortable, anarchs in- \ncluded. Those with a talent for it often find themselves stymied by a lack of magical \nresources and teachers, making advancement torturously slow and prone to many \nfrustrating dead ends and experimental failures along the way. Obsessed as most are \nwith avoiding capture, many anarch Thaumaturgy users eschew the more blatant \n(and noticeable) offensive powers it offers in favor of primarily defensive rituals and \nother passive magics, such as Deflection of the Wooden Doom and Defense of the Sacred \nHauen. Naturally, even the brutal conditions under which these so-called “gutter \nmages” exist cannot suppress the spark of mystical creativity that powers this \nDiscipline, and over time a number of new rituals and other tricks unique to the \nanarchs have been cautiously circulated by those few free Thaumaturgy users in the \nMovement. In addition, while exceptions exist, anarchs are generally limited to the \nmost common paths of Thaumaturgy, since the Tremere zealously track down those \nwho display any facility with the rarer forms of magic, and the forces they send out \nto “discipline” such rogues have no problem storming a communal haven and \nincinerating everyone they find in order to accomplish their mission. This goes \ndouble for those known to teach Thaumaturgy to outsiders, especially those in \npossession of the new rituals devised by anarch magicians, and an unofficial code of \n“death before capture” has arisen between all anarch Thaumaturgy wielders. Given \nwhat the Tremere are likely to inflict on them, this is a sensible policy indeed. \nCOMBINATION \nDISCIPLINES \nOver the centuries, many anarchs have discovered innovative ways to use the \npowers of their vampiric blood, much as their rivals in the sects have done. Indeed, \nmore than one Cainite scholar has speculated that the eternal struggle between the \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n54 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndifferent vampiric factions has been the catalyst for the evolution of these specialized \nDiscipline applications, several more mainstream Disciplines and even some of the \nminor bloodlines. Wise anarchs who come across the secrets of these combination \nDisciplines hold them in reserve until they are absolutely necessary, as they reprlesent \none of the few edges unique to the Cause; the less the enemy is allowed to know cl \nr b out \nthem, the better. \nListed for each combination Discipline is an Experience Trait cost and the \nprerequisite Disciplines a character must possess before he can attempt to master this \nnew power. Characters who fail to meet either of these requirements cannot even \nattempt the feats described - \nthose who have the prerequisite Disciplines but who \nhave not spent the necessary Experience Traits lack the necessary understanding to \nperform what the combination Discipline entails. It is also within a Storyteller’s \ndiscretion to disallow any or all of these combination Disciplines. While intended to \nexpand roleplaying opportunities and demonstrate the heights vampiric power can \nreach with suitable effort and dedication, they can also be abused by power-hungry \nand unscrupulous players, and the Storyteller should always ensure that the needs of \nthe story and the game as a whole come before a few lines on a character sheet. \nThese combination Disciplines cannot be taken at character creation, regardless \nof what a character’s backstory might be; all combination Disciplines require an in- \ncharacter teacher and ideally should only be earned after a suitable period of extensive \ninvestigation and painstaking experimentation. It is therefore highly recommended \nthat the requisite Experience Traits for a combination Discipline not be spent all at \nonce, but rather spent over a period of time to reflect the student’s efforts to master her \nnew power. Not only does that evocatively demonstrate to the player the amount of \ntime it takes to master these complex Disciplines, but it also keeps the new Discipline \nfrom seeming to “magically appear” on a character’s sheet between one game and the \nnext, and encourages the acquisition of it to become part of the character’s personal \nstoryline. In addition, Storytellers should remember that required teachers are rare, and \nfew anarchs possess such unique variations to the standard Disciplines. Finding a \nsuitable instructor can easily be the goal of a fairly long storyline involving of a number \nof expensive favors, thorough investigation and personal growth. \nNote: For purposes of power comparison, a combination Discipline is consid- \nered to be the same level as the highest-level Discipline it requires to learn. Thus, if \na combination Discipline requires two Basic Disciplines and one Advanced Disci- \npline, it is considered an Advanced power. \nAspect of Beast \nPrerequisites: Intermediate Animalism, Intermediate Dominate \nThis Discipline calls upon the victim’s inner bestial nature and causes it to \nmanifest physically. The victim takes on the mien of an animal. Most people \nwitnessing this power in use have an eerie and unsettling impression that the target \nis obviously not human. In other cases, it is much more severe - \nthe target’s Beast \nactually comes to the surface, altering her appearance into a beast-human hybrid \ncapable of causing panic in mortals and the weak-willed. \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKING UP THE FIGHI \n55 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThis Discipline costs one Blood Trait to activate and requires the user to best the \nintended victim in a Social Test. It can be retested with Empathy. Those seeing the \nvictim of Aspect of the Beast will perceive her as having a pronounced animal \ncharacteristic. This feral appearance is the result of the character’s temperament and \nreflects the target’s personality. The Storyteller has the final say on whether or not \nan animal aspect is appropriate and approves the appearance of the manifestation. \nA Ventrue loan shark may appear to have a multitude of teeth, making his predatory \nnature plain, while a clever and unscrupulous Nosferatu who has wronged the anarch \nmay appear as a fox with large ears and a pointy muzzle, or a brutal and repressive \nCamarilla scourge might manifest his inner creature by taking on the snout of a pig. \nIf the victim has less than three permanent Willpower Traits, he literally appears \nas a “beast-man” and will cause Delirium in non-supernatural creatures, just as if they \nhave seen a werewolf.. . or worse. The victim is down two Social Traits on all \nchallenges and the witnesses’ reaction to the bestial visage should be actively role- \nplayed. Remember that this power is a Dominate-based Discipline, and the Kindred \nusing it must be of equal or lower generation for it to work. This Discipline only \nfunctions on one victim at a time, although it can be used on multiple victims per \nsession with additional Blood Traits and Social Tests. The effect lasts one full night; \nthe victim’s appearance returns to normal at sunrise. The victim gains the Negative \nSocial Traits Bestial x2, Repugnant and Feral for the rest of the night and must wear \nan appropriate tag describing her altered appearance. Obfuscate will not disguise this \nferal mien, though the bestial outward form does not prevent actual invisibility. \nThis power costs 8 Experience Traits to learn. \nBadger’s Hide \nPrerequisites: Basic Fortitude, Intermediate Protean (Shpe of the Beast) \nA Gangrel developed this Protean-based combination Discipline for defense, \nmaking the user’s skin exceedingly leathery and tough. In the wild, a badger’s thick hide \nrepels bee stings; likewise, Badger’s Huh is specially designed to repel impaling attacks. \nThis Discipline costs one Blood Trait to activate and lasts for one scene. Any \nprimarily piercing melee attacks such as knives, stakes, spears or arrows will do one \nless level of lethal damage for that scene, to a minimum of no damage. Weapons that \nmerely slash or hack such as swords or axes are unaffected by this power, unless the \nattacker is specifically attempting to impale the vampire with them (such as trying \nto stab the vampire through the heart). Additionally, the increased resistance \nconferred while this power is active allows the user to spend a stamina-related \nPhysical Trait to receive a retest on any staking tests (including the two additional \ntests required to stake successfully). Only one Physical Trait may be spent per test, \nhowever. Staking attacks that inflict no damage after this and other powers reduce \ndamage do not receive a chance to stake the vampire. The Storyteller is the final \njudge over whether Badger’s Hide is effective against aparticular form of attack. This \nDiscipline is useless against bullets and other high-velocity projectiles, though other \nlevels of Fortitude can be used normally in addition to this power to further ameliorate \nany damage the user sustains. \nThis power costs 6 Experience Traits to learn. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n56 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCall Upon the Blood \nPrerequisites: Advanced Animalism, Intermediate Auspex (Telepathy) \nEver resourceful, the anarchs developed this Discipline to scout out the location \nof other vampires in the area, learning their numbers and possibly locating their \nstrongholds with enough practice. This power enables a Kindred to sense the Beast \nwithin her targets, allowing her to find other Kindred, ghouls and even certain were- \ncreatures by sensing that primal spark deep within them. The Animalism Discipline \nattunes the user to any creature that harbors a Beast, and the Auspex aspect of this \npower permits him to interpret that sensation and extend his senses beyond his \nnormal limits. By using this ability, the scout can tell approximately how many \nKindred and ghouls are in the area. The power does not cause a bright red neon arrow \nto point to the local undead, but it does offer a rough estimate of Kindred or ghoul \npresence nearby. \nThis Discipline costs one Blood Trait to activate and requires a Menta[ Test \nagainst a difficulty of six Traits with the Storyteller. (Retest with Suretiettzl.) If \nsuccessful, the character receives an impression of how many individuals with Beasts \nare nearby, as well as a general idea of their proximity. If a Storyteller is not available, \nor if the players prefer this application in general, this Discipline allows the user to \nmake a Mental Test against a particular individual; if successful, the user may ask the \ntarget “Are you a vampire or a ghoul?” The target must answer honestly. Those \nsubjected to this power may make an Awareness Test to sense the Discipline’s use, as \nusing it gently stirs the Beast, but cannot tell from what or which direction the strange \nsense is coming - \nonly that someone is probing for the presence of the Beast nearby. \nA character can only use Call Upon the Blood for up to 10 minutes. Attempting \nit more times in a night than the user has Self-Control/Instinct Traits may require the \nuser to test against frenzy or risk fully awakening her own Beast in the process. In no \ncase can a character use this Discipline more than twice as many times per night as \nher rating in that particular Virtue Trait. \nThis power costs 9 Experience Traits to learn. \nChaos Fold \nPrerequisites: Advanced Dementation, Intermediate Dominate (Conditioning) \nMalkavians are more common among the anarchs than one would imagine. \nThey have much to offer the Movement, and Chaos Fold is one of the ultimate \nexpressions of their power to help the Anarch Cause. It allows the Malkavian to \n“fold” a latent Derangement into a target’s psyche. The Derangement lies in wait \nuntil a certain event triggers it, in a manner similar to the Dominate power of \nMesmerism. This trigger causes the Derangement to become active and the target \nsuffers a full-blown attack of the implanted Derangement. Until it is triggered, the \nsubject does not suffer from the Derangement, and is not even aware of its presence \nunless it is somehow brought to his attention (such as a particularly dedizated \nTelepathy or Forgetful Mind search). Once triggered, the Derangement remain: fully \nand violently active for the scene or hour (whichever is longer), during which time \nthe target cannot even spend Willpower to momentarily subdue his madness, though \nCHAITR Two: TAKING \nUP THE FIGHT \n51 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhe may still defend himself normally. The Derangement brought on by this Disci- \npline disappears completely after the scene in which it is triggered, though of course \nthe victim may be targeted by this power again in the future. A victim may not be \ntargeted by this power more than once at a time, however. \nTo use Chaos Fold, the user selects an appropriate Derangement and makes a \nSocial Test against the target, retested by Empathy. The wielder is two Traits down \non the test if she does not have that particular Derangement herself. This Derang- \nement then lies dormant in the targeted character until a trigger event happens, at \nwhich point it manifests in full force as an active Derangement. If the unfortunate \nvictim of Chaos Fold has three or fewer permanent Willpower Traits, the wielder may \nchoose to spend a Willpower Trait to make the Derangement permanent once it is \ntriggered, in which case the target must buy it off normally after a period of therapy \nand similar mental rehabilitation. Because this is still aDominate--based power, it can \nonly be used against mortals or Kindred of equal or higher generation. \nChaos Fold costs 12 Experience Traits to learn. \nGive ‘Em Hell \nPrerequisites: Basic Fortitude or Potence, Intermediate Presence \nWhen push comes to shove and violence is the only remaining option, the \nchampions of the Cause can use Give ‘Ern Hell to motivate and inspire their fellow \nanarchs to stay the course rather than run to fight another night. This Discipline \nrallies the troops to perform greater feats of valor when the odds are against them. By \nmaking a display ofhis physical prowess during the fight, such as throwing a barricade \naside or ignoring the pain of a blow that would drop a lesser vampire to his knees, the \nanarch inspires others to greater acts. Using the Discipline requires a dramatic display \nof fearlessness in the face of danger that is clearly witnessed by those the anarch \nwishes to affect. \nAfter a suitably inspirational display of courage and physical prowess, the player \nmakes a Social Test against a difficulty of seven Traits, retesting with Leadership. He \ncan then choose up to three other characters within his line of sight who will gain \nan extra Courage Trait for the remainder of the fight. This extra Courage Trait cannot \nexceed the maximum number of Virtue Traits permitted - \nif this would bring a \nvampire over the limit, the excess is converted to temporary Willpower instead. The \nwielder cannot use this Discipline on himself, nor can it be used more than once on \nthe same target per combat, though it may be used multiple times to cover a number \nof different allies. Anarchs known to use Give ‘Em Hell are watched closely by their \nmore cynical comrades; sell-outs occasionally use this power to bolster the strength \nof foes of the Movement just before betraying their former companions, causing not \nonly a devastating defeat but also a crippling blow to local morale. \nThis Discipline costs 6 Experience Traits to learn. \nGuardian Vigil \nPrerequisites: Basic Auspex, Basic Celerity, Basic Fortitude \nAnarchs who endured long periods of guard duty during the Anarch Revolt first \ndeveloped this Discipline, and it still sees use in modern times. The character must \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n58 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nspend a Blood Trait to activate this power; once active, so long as she does not move \nmore than three paces from where she started the Guardian Vigil, the user cannot be \nSurprised by any conventional means. In fact, the user is two Traits up on all \nChallenges that would normally surprise her, due to her unexpected readiness. ‘Only \nsupernatural powers provide any way of getting past the guard, and even they a.ren’t \nquite as effective as normal (see below). Guardian Vigil lasts until one full hour has \npassed, the anarch moves more than three paces from her appointed spot or \nsomething comes along that triggers a violent response from the guard. \nInessence, this Discipline allows the anarch to enter a trance-like state ofhyper- \nawareness for long periods of time, ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice. \nShould a direct threat appear, the user can activate her Celerity to pre-empt the threat \nnormally, even if it’s something like a sniper attack or is otherwise not normally \ncovered by Alacrity. The normal rules for Obfuscate apply, so if a person attempting \nto sneak by the user has more Obfuscate than the anarch has Auspex, the cloaking \neffect of Obfuscate protects the transgressor. In the case of resisted tests, the anarch \nis two Traits up to detect the Obfuscated character, due to the user’s increased \nawareness of her surroundings. Guardian Vigil completely prohibits the use of Stealth \nand other mundane methods of sneaking past the anarch - \nthey simply do not work, \nregardless of how skilled someone is in such abilities. \nAs potent as it is, there are limits to Guardian Vigil - \nthe actions taken against \nthe anarch using this Discipline must affect him directly and immediately for this \npower to activate. While it can foil a sniper on the rooftop, it does not detect a camera \nplaced there during the day and remote-controlled at night to record the vampires \npresent, for example, nor would it detect or prevent a threat against one of the user’s \ncompanions. It can be activated as often as one likes per game, but each activation \ncosts an additional Blood Trait and works for only one immediate threat. \nGuardian Vigil requires 7 Experience Traits to learn. \nKing of the Hill \nPrerequisites: Advanced Fortitude, Intermediate Presence \nThis Discipline is proof of what happens when an immovable object meets a \nnormally irresistible force. It was developed by agang leader in the Anarch Free State \nwho allegedly met his Final Death when he tested the power of this Disciplirie by \nplaying chicken with a speeding freight train. The train won the game, but the sang \nleader’s feet remained firmly planted between the rails. \nThis power costs nothing to use and is considered always on, and prevents a \nKindred from being knocked off her feet by any means that would not instantly cause \nFinal Death. Attacks still inflict damage normally, but will not knock the anarch \ndown, force her back or otherwise move her short of inflicting Final Death. Using this \nDiscipline often breaches the Masquerade - \na car that hits a vampire using King of \nthe Hill will be knocked back or wrapped around the Kindred as if it hit a telephone \npole - \nbut as a means of intimidation or morale boosting it remains impressive. The \nuser receives a free retest on all Intimidation or Leadership tests with any witnesses who \nhave seen her demonstrate her inhuman endurance in the current scene. \nCHAPTER \nTwo: TAKING UP THE FIGHI \n59 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThis Discipline will not protect Kindred from completely encompassing or \ninhumanly powerful impacts such as a speeding train or a crashing airplane. Such \ndevastating impacts and the fire caused by the resultant spilled fuel would turn \nKindred to ash, send various body parts flying all over and otherwise cause Final \nDeath. (Rumors persist of an even more powerful variant that includes Potence and \nallows for truly staggering feats of resilience.. . but they remain rumors at present.) \nNaturally, additional levels of Fortitude can be used to alleviate the damage withstood \nusing King of the Hill until the Kindred reaches Incapacitated. When Incapacitated, \nhe is still standing up, but can only bid Stamina-related Traits. Only when the user \nenters torpor or Final Death is inflicted does he at last fall. The severity of a given \nobject’s impact and the damage sustained are ultimately up to the Storyteller. \nThis Discipline costs 8 Experience Traits. \nMemory Rift \nPrerequisites: Advanced Obfuscate, Intermediate Presence \nBy using Vanish From the Mind’s Eye and sheer charisma, the Kindred creating \na Memory Rift disappears completely from the memory of a target. The target’s \nmemory replaces the disappearance with the most logical alternative it can create, \nsuch as imagining that a mortal police officer fell or jumped off a bridge rather than \nhaving been pushed by the user of this Discipline. The target will strongly resist \nattempts to convince her otherwise, since her mind has created a believable \nreplacement for the missing memory. Even direct evidence to the contrary will be \ngreeted with deep skepticism. \nThis Discipline requires the expenditure of a Blood Trait and a Mental Trait, \nand the user must make aSocialTest against the target, retesting withsubterfuge. The \nuser may attempt to influence more than one target in a scene, but must spend Traits \nand test against each target individually; she cannot make agroup challenge with this \npower. If successful, the target not only ignores the character, but by the coming dawn \nforgets the user was ever there. Once activated, the character can take no aggressive \naction against the target and must leave within five minutes after activating the \nDiscipline, remaining out of the target’s sensory range for at least a full hour of game \nplay. Failure to stay out of sensory range, even if Obfuscated or otherwise supernatu- \nrally concealed, causes the target’s memories of the user to flood back at dawn and \nessentially ruins the use of this power. \nRemember that targets still recall any events that happened, just not the \npresence of the anarch using Memory Rift. If a target witnessed the anarch shooting \nsomeone, he will still remember the shooting - \nhis mind will simply make up \nanother suspect or even alter his memories to ensure that ‘‘I didn’t get a good look \nat him. Or her. I’m not even sure. Sorry.”The use of this Discipline can be uncovered \nwith the proper use of Dominate and similar powers that probe the memory, though \nits insinuative nature puts such seekers three Traits down on all relevant tests unless \nthey know exactly what they are looking for and/or have dealt with this Discipline \nin the past. \nLearning Memory Rift costs 5 Experience Traits. \nt\nTHE ANARCH GJIDE \n60 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRetain the Quick Blood \nPrerequisites: Advanced Celerity, Advanced Quietus \nWhen the original Anarch Revolt erupted in Europe, the Assamite clan had an \ninformal alliance with the antitribu who sought to throw off the bondage of their \nelders. Few anarchs possessed knowledge of the Quietus Discipline, but a handful did, \nand developed this potent Discipline to aid in conserving their passionate blood. \nThese modern nights, few anarchs know Quietus, and even fewer have ever heard of \nthis exceedingly rare combination Discipline. However, when employed its effects \nare spectacular, as Retain the Quick Blood allows a Kindred to conserve her precious \nvitae without spending it as liberally as is normally required to fuel Celenty. \nAny Blood Traits spent to activate Celerity (and only Celerity) return to the \ncharacter’s system in one full hour. Blood Traits returned in this manner can never \nexceed the character’s maximum Blood Trait pool, and any excess returning Traits \nare lost. The vitae returns due to astrange anomaly in the Kindred’s biology, the same \nanomaly that makes Assamite blood so unique and deadly. This Discipline’s use is not \nvisible to onlookers. This Discipline does not bestow an unlimited supply of vitae on \nits user, as it takes time to regain the expended Blood Traits, and hunger frenzy i s  still \narisk in combat when avampire pushes her limits using Disciplines that require blood \nto fuel them. \nStorytellers should keep a close eye on those seeking to learn this Discipline - \nit \nis exceedingly rare even for a combination Discipline, and those few Assamite anarchs \nwho know its secrets never impart it without asking a high price in return. Accordingly, \nits acquisition should be the culmination of a suitably involved and demanding story, \nnot just a way to spend a few excess Experience Traits one has lying around. \nRetain the Quick Blood costs 10 Experience Traits. \nSensory Overload \nPrerequisites: Basic Auspex, Intermediate Dementation \nAnarch Malkavians are always a force to be reckoned with because of the \nuniquely disturbing ways they find to use their already unsettling Disciplines against \ntheir enemies. One such use is Sensory Overload, an offensive Discipline that \ncombines the paranormal phenomena perceived by Auspex with the madness and \ndelusions spread through Dementation. This Discipline allows a Kindred to force his \nAuspex powers upon another, but the sensory or mental input of the Auspex is twisted \nby the Dementation. The user cannot control the precise effects of this Discipline; \nwhile he may choose the level of Auspex he wishes to “bestow” on his target in hopes \nof inspiring a particular response, the exact effects generated are entirely within the \nStoryteller’s discretion. By the same token, this Discipline always manifests in a \nmanner that is distracting, painful or socially dangerous for the target; while she may \ncertainly believe she is learning something genuinely valuable, this Discipline never \ngenerates a beneficial result for the target. \nTo active this Discipline, the user must choose a target and make a successful \nSocial Test, retested by Empathy, and spend a Willpower Trait. The Auspex effect \n“given” to the target must be a level of Auspex the user has. (You cannot force \nCHAP~ER \nTwo TAKING UP THE FIGHT \n61 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTelepathy on a target if you only possess Heightened Senses, for example.) Examples of \npossible effects of Sensory Overloud based on the level of Auspex granted are provided \nbelow. This Discipline lasts for a number of hours equal to the user’s permanent \nWillpower Traits minus the target’s current Willpower Traits, with a minimum \nduration of one hour. Note that the Malkavian wielding this power (for no other clan \nhas yet braved the excruciating process of learning this Discipline) retains full \ncommand of Auspex during this time - \nhe does not truly “loan” his power to the \ntarget, only a fractured, horrifying reflection of it. \nRegardless of the specific effects generated, all targets of Sensory Overload suffer a \ntwo-Trait penalty to all Social and Mental tests for the duration of the power due to the \nconstant distraction from this phantom input, and are required to roleplay their \ndisorientation and mistaken impressions to the best of their capability. At the \nStoryteller’s discretion, particularly susceptible targets such as those with Acute Senses, \nrelevant Derangements or other specific “weak points” for this power to exploit might \nbe required to spend a Willpower Trait to avoid being overcome with sensory input, \nor even suffer an active Derangement for the duration of the Discipline. While these \nperceptions may certainly shock the target, even those who have a compelling reason \nto disbelieve the false input they’re offered still can’t bring themselves to ignore it, and \nthose less knowledgeable in psychic manipulation are likely to either believe in the \nvisions they are granted or at best believe they are suffering some kind of psychotic fit. \nTargets who already possess the level of Auspex targeted by Sensory Overload may make \na Mental Test with the Awareness Ability against the user’s Mental Traits to discern \nthat something is wrong with their perceptions, but otherwise they are even more likely \nto believe their perceptions than most targets, accustomed as they are to receiving such \nsupernatural sensory information. \nIt costs 8 Experience Traits to learn Sensory Overload. \nSeventh Chinese Brother \nPrerequisites: Intermediate Celerity, Elder Fortitude (Personal Armor) \nOnce upon a time in China, there were seven brothers, and each one had a \nspecial natural ability. The seventh brother had iron bones that prevented his death \nby decapitation. This Discipline allows the user to emulate that seventh Chinese \nbrother by hardening one part of his body and improving the entire body’s recupera- \ntive properties so that the user’s limbs cannot be severed or her flesh punctured. \nAnarchs employing this Discipline most often use it to save their own heads, quite \nliterally, but it works just as well on a hand, arm, leg or foot, should the need arise to \nprotect these extremities. \nTo activate the power, the user must spend a Willpower Trait and select a single \nappendage. (The neck and head count as a single appendage for purposes of this \nDiscipline.) The next blow that should sever that appendage is then ignored and does \nno damage, nor does the victim of the strike suffer any penalty. The power can be \nreactivated at the beginning of the next turn to prevent loss of the head or limb. As \nlong as the user has Willpower Traits, she can protect herself in this fashion. A lesser- \nknown but still legitimate use of this Discipline is to harden the muscles, tendons and \nt\nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n62 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPTER \nTWO: TAMNG \nUP THE Ficm \n63 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbones around the heart. In this case, a Kindred can at least prevent being staked until \nhis Willpower runs out. The duration of this effect is one scene or until a sufficiently \npowerful blow is struck, whichever comes first. If a scene ends before the decapitat- \ning, amputating, or disabling blow is struck, the power has no effect and can be \nactivated again in a later scene. \nBecause targeting specific limbs is not generally permitted in Mind Eye’s \nTheatre, the Storyteller may wish to modify this power or even disallow it outright \nifhe does not feel it offers a significant benefit in the game. (Keep in mind the benefits \nit offers against staking, however.) \nIt costs 12 Experience Traits to learn this power. \nSmiling Jack‘s Trick \nPrerequisites: Advanced Dominate, Advanced Obfuscate \nAccording to the legend attributed to this combination Discipline, a vicious \nCamarilla scourge and his lieutenant once cornered the notorious anarch Smiling \nJack. Jack did his trick and the scourge turned on his loyal lieutenant while Jack \nescaped laughing into the night. The lieutenant was turned to ash and the scourge \nwas disgraced, as he lost a highly esteemed lieutenant and let a known fugitive escape \nin the process. This Discipline uses Obfuscate to trick the mind and senses and uses \nDominate to further confuse someone into believing that the user is another person \nin the immediate vicinity. The user can apparently switch identities with any person \nwithin 10 steps of her. \nSmiling Jack’s Trick requires a Mental Test against the person the user intends to \ndeceive (not the person whose appearance she intends to switch); it may be used \nagainst multiple targets with a regular group test, although the user may only switch \nidentities with one person at a time. If successful, the person with whom the user \nswitched takes on the user’s appearance, while the anarch himself assumes the other’s \nappearance down to the smallest detail. This identity shift lasts for one hour, time \nthat is generally best spent leaving the area before the ruse is discovered. Like all \nDominate effects, it can only be used against a target of equal or higher generation. \nSmiling Jack’s Trick costs 9 Experience Traits to learn. \nSuck It Up \nPrerequisites: Basic Animalism, Advanced Protean \nAnarchs are no strangers to spilled blood, whether their own or that of those they \ntangle with. However, spilled blood, regardless of how it got there, tends to attract \na lot of unwanted attention. No matter who wins the fight, some anarchs have come \nup with an ingenious way to hide their conflicts and “clean up” the wasted blood, \nwhether from a pool on the sidewalk or an incriminating stain on a carpet. The last \nthing a vampire wants is to be seen voraciously licking the sidewalk like an ice cream \ncone or looming over the body of a fallen comrade drinking the remains of her vitae. \nKindred are advised to employ Suck It Up discreetly, as use of this Discipline is \nobviously not normal or natural. \nA Kindred using this Discipline merely touches the pool of blood and absorbs it \nlike a sponge at a rate of one Trait per turn. Suck It Up requires a successful Mental \nt\ni\nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n64 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTest against a difficulty of six Traits, which can be retested with the Surukal or \nScrounge Abilities. The absorbed Blood Traits go into the Kindred’s pool, and cannot \nexceed her maximum number of Blood Traits. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of \nhow much blood can be sucked up from a particular pool in this manner. The \n“vacuuming up” does not do the job perfectly; telltale stains remain (though faint), \nand the dried husks of bloodless bodies certainly constitute a major Masquerade \nbreach. Unless thoroughly scoured with other means such as chemical cleaning \nagents, enough traces of blood remain on the scene to perform forensic analysis. \nIt costs 5 Experience Traits to learn this power. \nTenebrous Veil \nPrerequisites: Basic Obfuscate (Unseen Presence), Basic Obtenebration \nThis simple but effective combination Discipline, devised by Malkaviari and \nLasombra anarchs, combines the basic properties of Obfuscate and Obtenebr&m. \nWhile Cloak of Shadows warps the mind’s perceptions, Tenebrous Veil further prevents \nbeing seen by wrapping the very stuff of the shadows around the hiding vampire. \nProvided a shadow is available, with the expenditure of a Blood Trait a Kindred can \nstand perfectly motionless and wrap that shadow around herself, allowing her to remain \nunseen as long as she stays motionless and does not make a sound. This Discipline has \nno effect on other Obfuscate powers, as movement or speech of any kind disrupts the \nveil immediately. What’s more, the addition of the shadow prevents anyone from using \nAuspex to see through the Discipline’s Obfuscate aspect, even if the Auspex user has \nmore levels of that Discipline than the Tenebrous Veil user has Obfuscate. However, as \nLasombra are quite rare among anarchs, this Discipline is not common and thus \nremains relatively unknown despite its potential usefulness. \nTenebrous Veil costs 3 Experience Traits. \nANARCH \nTHAUMATURGY \nAnarch Thaumaturgy is incredibly rare, as few Tremere manage to liberate \nthemselves from the Pyramid and survive for long enough to develop new ritual:; and \npaths. In addition, few anarchs have time for the grueling research and experimen- \ntation required to make great strides in Thaumaturgy. Few anarch Tremere have \nmastered the Discipline or even possess a particularly advanced understanding of it, \nand so very few new rituals exist. Sometimes the rumor mill provides whispers about \nrogue tomes of blood sorcery, rituals and secrets pilfered from Tremere libraries. \nThese stories come and go in waves, but they always interest Camarilla-serving \nTremere eager to uncover new rituals and magic to rise in the Tremere hierarcl- y, or \neven just earn easy prestige from their elders by capturing or destroying a rogue clan \nmember. Add to this the fact that more than a few such stories are actually traps laid \nby the Tremere to lure unwary anarchs to their demise, and it’s small wonder that \nAnarch Thaumaturgy advances so slowly. \nUnless otherwise noted, all ritual requirements listed are considered in addl tion \nto any tests or expenditures normally required for casting a Thaumaturgy ritual, as \noutlined in Laws of the Night, p. 185. \nCHAPTERTWO: \nTAKING \nUPTHL FIGHI \n65 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBASIC RITUALS \nBanish Big Brother \nThis thoroughly modern ritual allows the thaumaturge to detect and potentially \nnullify technological eavesdropping devices -microphones, \ntape recorders, surveil- \nlance cameras and so on. In addition to normal ritual requirements, the caster must \nalso completely bum a captured representation of himself such as a picture or vocal \nrecording; additional participants in the ritual must bring their own items to be \nconsumed in this fashion. When the items are completely destroyed, recipients must \nsprinkle the remains over themselves for the ritual to take effect. Until the next \nsunrise, those affected by this ritual automatically feel a buzzing sensation along the \nbacks of their necks any time they are taped or monitored by such devices, as well as \nsensing the general nature of the machine (listening, watching, recording, etc.) and \nits approximate location relative to the ritual recipient. The ritual does not reveal if \nanyone is operating the device, however, nor does it impart any working knowledge \nof how to use or disable it. \nOnce a Kindred is aware of the attempted surveillance, he may spend a Mental \nTrait to temporarily disable the devices involved. Simple technology such as tape \nrecorders or ATM cameras malfunction automatically; disabling more complex \nsystems or remote devices may also require a Mental Test (retest Security), at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. Affected items become hopelessly inoperative until the end \nof the scene, at which time they resume functioning normally. Disabling an item is \nconsidered “pre-emptive” to it recording the user in any way; if a photographer is \nwaiting in the bushes and leaps out to take a surprise picture of the Kindred, the \nritualist still gets a normal test to attempt to disable the camera before a picture is \ntaken. Magical technology or sentient devices cannot be disabled with this ritual, \nthough the thaumaturge will still be aware of them. \nThis ritual does not allow the Kindred to deactivate such devices at will; the \nrecipient cannot cause a person’s camera to malfunction if the person is taking a \npicture that didn’t include the Kindred, for example. Any such devices targeted must \nbe actively recording the recipient in order to be subject to this ritual, whether they \nwere intended to capture her or not. \nFlatline \nAfter incantations and ritual gestures, the ritualist causes a mortal to exhibit no \nsecondary characteristics of being alive. This ritual works on willing and unwilling \ntargets alike, and is a terrifying way of threatening one of the ritualist’s enemies. \nVictims have no pulse and no breath, and this apparent state of death also extends \nto mechanical devices regardless of how simple or complex. A heart monitor or \nelectrocardiogram will show the flat line of the ritual’s name, mirrors will not fog up \nwith breath, a stethoscope will hear only silence and so on. Even if stabbed or shot, \nthe mortal’s blood will not flow; it merely trickles out and wells up into a congealed \npool around the wound (though actual damage inflicted does not change). This \npower lasts until the sunrise after the night it is cast. It has no effect on supernatural \nbeings. To empower this ritual, the caster must place a small dead insect or animal \nsomeplace in the subject’s home. It must be the subject’s actual home, not a hotel \n+\nI\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n66 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nroom or a friend’s house where the target happens to be crashing. It does not work \non the homeless as a result of this ritual component, and regardless of the target’s \nnature a new insect must be placed for each casting. \nIron Body \nThis ritual allows the Kindred to tolerate the mythical and factual anathema to \ntheir kind. Similar to the Fortitude Discipline, Iron Body makes Kindred tougher. For \nevery 10 minutes spent performing this ritual, with a maximum of 40 minutes spent \ncasting it, the effect lasts one hour, and one level of aggravated damage sustained \nwithin that period is converted to lethal damage instead. Thus, a character who \nperformed this ritual for 40 minutes would be under its protection for four hours, \nduring which time up to four levels of aggravated wounds would be converted to \nlethal damage. Additional levels of aggravated damage inflicted beyond that amount \nor after the ritual ends are unaffected, and this ritual may not be performed again until \nthe first ritual has expired. Note that this ritual must be performed during in-game \ntime - \nif you want to show up with it on, you must show up at least 40 minutes after \nplay begins (or for however long you want your character to have done the ritual), \nor take an uninterrupted break of up to 40 minutes during play while performing the \nritual. The ritual’s subject must also carry a spent shell casing with him while this \nritual is in use. \nINTFRMFDIATF \nRITUALS \nDetect the Hidden Observer \nThis ritual was supposedly developed by the same paranoid Warlock who \ndevised Banish Big Brother, as a means of further ensuring that valuable secrets do not \nfall into the hands of enemies of the Movement. It was intended to allow the ritualist \nto completely block supernatural means of eavesdropping in the same fashion as its \ncousin disables surveillance devices, but unfortunately unknown enemies destroyed \nthe Warlock before he could complete his work. To enact this ritual, the caster must \ndrain a Blood Trait and cast it into a fire fueled by personal documents or recordings; \ncopies will suffice, but they must be the caster’s own work. After the fire dies down, \nthe ritualist must anoint her forehead, each eye and each ear with the ashes that \nremain, leaving small telltale black marks for those who know what to look for - \nthough given the rarity of Anarch Thaumaturgy, few do. \nUntil the next sunrise, the ritual recipient feels a sharp pain in her eyes, ears or \nforehead whenever another individual uses Supernatural powers to actively spy on \nher, thus allowing her to end her conversation before giving away valuable secrets or \nhide whatever secret materials the hidden observer was after. The user also discovers \nthe type of attempted surveillance - \nlistening, watching, telepathic contact, etc. \nHowever, unlike Banish Big Brother, this ritual does not block these powers in any way, \nnor does it offer any clues about where they are coming from or the identity of the \nobserver; it only alerts the character to their use. Likewise, this ritual does not protect \nagainst supernatural powers that do not directly spy on the user; for example, it will \nnot detect a Nosferatu using Obfuscate to stand in the comer and listen to what is \nbeing said, because Obfuscate is not providing him with any information. However, \nCHAPTER TWO: TAKM UP THE FIGHT \n67 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nif he uses Heightened Senses to listen in on the conversation, the ritual functions \nnormally. Likewise, this ritual won’t immediately detect a character employing \nTelepathy to send the recipient a message, but Telepathy attempting to plumb the \nuser’s mind for information would be detected. Last but not least, it does not block \nconventional eavesdropping - \nif the ritualist is careless enough to let someone \noverhear or otherwise spy on him directly, that’s his own problem. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, particularly mighty elders or similarly powerful \ncreatures may be immune to this ritual, though this should be rare and reserved for \nthose who have specifically cultivated their talents at Supernatural surveillance, or \nelse this ritual quickly loses its usefulness. \nHell’s Calling \nBurning someone’s personal item when enacting this ritual causes that person to \nimmediately succumb to Rotschreck, regardless ofwhether any flame is present and what \nthe target was doing when the ritual was enacted. This ritual requires 30 minutes of time \nto perform and an iron brazier. In the past this ritual was used to humiliate enemies by \nforcing them to act like irrational lunatics and even break the resolve of opposition forces \nat a critical moment. This fear frenzy is identical to Rotschreck in nearly every way and \ncan be warded off or controlled with the usual Willpower or Courage/Self-Control tests. \nIf the target fails the test, he is seized by supernatural panic and runs away screaming, \nknockingdownanyoneinhispathwithoutgivingany \nindicationofwhat isterrifying him; \nhowever, the fear triggered by this ritual is not like normal Rotschreck in that the victim \nof Hell’s Calling can calm down immediately once away from the environment where the \nterror gripped him. Of course, the victim has no idea why he suddenly feared for his very \nunlife, which in itself can be bad enough for image-conscious elders. \nWard Versus Vitae \nAfter anointing an object with a sigil drawn in the user’s own blood while chanting \nmystical words, this anarch-specific ritual wards against more powerful Cainites. This ritual \nis commonly used to protect the caster from the unwelcome intrusion of elder vampires, \nmaking it a shared defense of many communal Free Tremere havens. This is not a “Ward \nversus Kindred,” but rather a specific ward against those of more potent blood. It can be cast \non any single object from dagger- to door-sized. It causes one Trait of lethal damage to any \nKindred of lower generation than the caster who crosses the threshold of the doorway or \ntouches the object. This damage bypasses armor and even other mystical protections. So if \nan eleventh-generation anarch inscribes the sigil on his haven door, Kindred of tenth or \nlower generation suffer the pain of breaking the ward. It is otherwise considered a normal \nward, and lasts until the night after inscribing it. It can be used on all exits and entrances \nin aroom, including windows, provided the ritual is repeated for eachnew item or entrance. \nThis ward cannot be “stacked” multiple times on a single item or entrance. \nHIGH \nLFVFL \nDISCI~LINFS \nElders can be found among the ranks of the anarchs, fighting for the cause \nalongside the much larger number of younger Kindred. Much to the embarrassment \nand annoyance of other Kindred, elders who struggle for freedom and self-determi- \nnation brought with them some unexpected and unusual tactics of their own. These \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n68 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisciplines provide a few tricks up the sleeves of the few elder anarchs, who are often \nunderestimated by their peers in the established sects. Please see The Camarilla \nGuide, page 40, for experience point costs and generation requirements for high- \nlevel Disciplines. \nMaster Presence \nScourging the Instinct \nMore common amid the firebrands and fanatics of the Anarch Revolt, this pc)werful \nuse of charisma and the imposing personality of an elder enables her to stand before the \nassembled anarch packs and rally them into a crazed fervor, entering frenzy directed at the \ntarget of the elder’s ire. Those who succumb to the war cry of the firebrand have their Beasts \ncalled forth and are riding the wave of frenzy, oblivious to all but their instincts. By giving \nan appropriately inspirational speech and directing the anger of the group at a single target \nor group of targets, the elder makes a mass Social Test (retesting with hdmsi‘up). If \nsuccesshl, the elder immediately causes as many Kindred as the elder has Social Traits to \nenter frenzy, regardless of the affected vampires’ Paths of Enlightenment. This frlmzy is \nalmost identical to regular frenzy, with several notable exceptions. First, those under the \nsway of this Discipline will naturally target the “enemies” described by the elder and need \nnot fear attacking each other in their rage, though other threats may temporarily draw their \nattention away from their target. Second, the affected vampires must continuously chant \nsome slogan or other war cry given to the them by the elder in question for this Disc:ipline \nto work; failure to do so immediately ends this Discipline’s effects. While extremely \nunnervingtobehold,thewarcryalsomakesthesourceofthisDisciplineeasytotraceinmost \ninstances, as many elders have used the same rallying cry over the centuries. Needless to say, \nthis Discipline is generally considered too dangerous for modem use, as it is essentially a dire \nMasquerade breach in progress - \na large pack of frenzying Kindred, even if inostly \ncomposed of neonates, can still cause carnage on an epic scale. \nMaster Protean \nTurnabout \nPrerequisite: Elder Protean (Earth Control) \nWhile rarely seen in the last few centuries, a few elders still practice this Discipline, \nmostly to win approval from the impressionable neonates and more importantly save \nthemselves when comered. Essentially a more potent version of the Earth C:on~rol \nDiscipline, Turnabout requires two Blood Traits to activate. The elder sinks into the \nground and instantly emerges behind or to the side of an enemy in her line of sight; the \nplayer decides exactly where her character intends to resurface, although the user \ncannot resurface directly under a person. If the character chooses, she may remain in \nthe ground for a period of time, but then the vampire is using Earth Control instead of \nTurnabout. Turnabout’s focus is on dropping down into the ground and popping up in \na more advantageous location, thereby catching an opponent by surprise. \nThis Discipline grants the user an automatic Surprise attack against an oppo- \nnent, regardless of any Celerity, Auspexor other powers related to speed or supernatural \nperception the opponent may possess. Such is the nature of the Surprise that the \ntarget is considered at a three-Trait penalty to defend himselffrom the elder’s attacks. \nCHAPTER \nTwo TANK UP THE FIGHI \n69 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWashing one’s hands of the conflict between \nthe powerful and the powerless means to side with \nthe powerful, not to be neutral. \n- \nPaulo Freire \nRFVOLUTIONRY \nNIGHT \nNo other subculture of vampire society is as diverse as the Anarch Movement, \nand no other is as plagued by internal strife. One may safely assume that there exist \nas many different anarch ideologies as exist anarchs to profess them: A random \nsampling from any major metropolitan area is as likely to result in a room full of \nenemies as allies. When an anarch gives a rallying cry, she has a particular platform \nin mind and woe inevitably comes to those who deviate from her party line. Rare is \nthe gang that remains together beyond the achievement of a single short-term goal \nunless held together by a powerful, charismatic leader. One issue after another \nbecomes an irreconcilable point of division until the coterie tears itself to shreds in \nfratricidal violence. Revolutionaries and reactionaries struggle to remake society \naccording to their dreams of a better world, even as the costs mount and the struggle \ncosts them friends, resources or their very minds to the Beast within. \nDespite paranoid rumors to the contrary, no over-arching global organization of \nanarchs exists to direct worldwide rebellion against elder tyranny. Innumerable \ndissidents certainly dream of such solidarity but for every coalition-builder in the \nmix, there are twice as many fanatics who refuse to compromise their ideals or \nmethods or twice as many opportunists with self-centered personal agendas. Indeed, \nmost anarchs have definite ideas about “how the world should be” and consider all \nwho disagree with them to be part of the problem, not the solution - \nand problems \nare for solving, not accommodating. When such firebrands call for unity, they are \nCHAPTER \nTHEE: THE REBEL UNLIR \n71 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nactually calling for mass acceptance of their dogma. Few realize this and fewer still \nwill admit it, but it remains true nonetheless. In practice, anarchs spend far more time \nfighting each other than fighting “the Man,” despite volumes of rhetoric to the \ncontrary. They always have and, as most elders snidely assert, they always will. \nYet despite this chaotic factionalism, somehow the ideals of the Anarch Revolt \nmanage to stay alive, even gain ground from time to time, to the frustration and \ndismay of Camarilla manipulators and Sabbat tacticians alike. For what makes the \nanarchs so maddeningly difficult to organize also makes them virtually impossible to \nstamp out; indeed, the more pressure their enemies apply, the more popular these foes \nfind the Movement becoming. Though they may become entangled in internal \nconflicts all too easily, the basic precepts of the Anarch Revolt are still simple and \nfundamental enough that they can be easily grasped by a wide variety of Kindred. \nPerhaps more importantly, they are stirring enough to fight for, a profound induce- \nment indeed when considering the jaded hearts of the undead. \nMYTHSOFTHP \nMOVPMFNT \nBefore one can begin a survey of the faces that make up the anarchs and their \nreasons for joining such adifficult cause, it is perhaps equally instructive to run through \na list of common misconceptions and stereotypes that many vampires hold regarding \nthese revolutionary undead. Most important of all, do not assume that rebellious \nbehavior indicates sympathy for anarch goals. (This is particularly true regarding petty \nvandalism or similar acts of mindless violence.) An elder attempting to seize praxis is \ncertainly a rebel - \nat least by the standards of his peers - \nand will be punished \naccordingly if he fails. He is not, however, an anarch, nor is he sympathetic to anarch \ngoals. On the contrary, he might very well believe the current prince has been entirely \ntoo indulgent regarding the local revolutionaries and intend to “crack down” on them \nas soon as he becomes the new prince. If so, the anarchs would do well to keep the \ncurrent prince on the throne unless the would-be ruler’s iron-fisted policies would \nultimately result in a net gain of new recruits with valuable resources for the struggle. \nSimilarly, a well-groomed neonate tagging an elder’s favorite gallery, museum or \ntheater with obscene graffiti is apoor example of an anarch at best. She has no particular \ncause. She makes no particular artistic or political statement. She just enjoys the \nadolescent thrill of “being naughty” and knows her sire will shield her from any truly \nserious consequences. She has no particular beef with “the System” and believes anarchs \nin general are, at best, hopelessly impractical. She might occasionally hang out with the \ntrendier “bad boys,” but she would roll on them in an instant to save her own ass. \nWhat about the stereotypical “young punks” who rumble in the Rack, bait the \nprince’s ghouls and keep the sheriff working overtime to preserve the Masquerade? \nEven such malcontents as these aren’t necessarily anarchs. “Young, dumb and full of \nattitude” accurately describes a lot of vampires on both sides of the political fence. \nThat loud-mouthed oaf throwing his weight around might be the local gang leader, \nbut he’s even more likely to be the local scourge or one of the sheriffs deputy bruisers \ntaking a night off. After all, you have a lot more weight to throw around - \nand a lot \nmore authority to throw it with - \nif you work for the Man. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDL \n12 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIndeed, contrary to what many elders would have neonates believe, compara- \ntively few anarchs actually thug their way through life and those who do rarely last \nlong. More often than not, their more socially responsible comrades quietly elimi- \nnate such loose cannons before their excesses provoke indiscriminate “final solutions” \nfrom infuriated princes. It’s just like military boot camp: If the entire platoon gets \ndropped for push-ups because one problem child caught the drill sergeant’s attention, \nit ain’t the drill sergeant who gets the blanket party. \nLast but certainly not least, dissatisfaction with the status quo is not the defining \ncharacteristic of an anarch. If it were, the elders would be right: every neonate less \nthan half a century old would be an anarch. So would most neonates more than half \na century old. So would most ancillae and quite a few elders. Dissatisfaction with the \nstatus quo is natural to anyone who isn’t king of as much of the hill as interests him, \nand very few vampires are satisfied with less than a mountain. However, exactly like \nthe mortals they once were, the overwhelming majority of vampires struggle beneath \nthe burden of a system they feel utterly powerless to change. The glass ceiling is crystal \nclear but is in no way weakened by its transparency. For all their deep dissatisfaction, \nthey continue to grunt and grind their way through immortality by the rule:;. The \ndefining characteristic of an anarch, then, is not thought but action. \nANARCHDFMOGRAPHICS \nWhat follows is a cursory survey of anarchs as a whole - \nnot who they are but \nwhat they are. Some stereotyping is unavoidable, but exceptions to the rules are \nalways possible. By their very nature, anarchs do not fit neatly into pigeonholes. \nAbsolutely none of these categories is anything more than incidental to a given \nanarch. What defines him as an anarch and differentiates him from others is what he \nbelieves and, within certain very broad generalizations, he might believe anything \nregardless of his age, generation or clan. \nANARCH~RY \nAGF \nMost anarchs currently active were Embraced in the 20th century. The Anarch \nMovement is primarily a youth movement among the undead. Since the ultimate goal \nof the Movement is to seize power from the elders, it is only natural that very few \nelders dare to support it. The longer an anarch has spent as a vampire, the more of \na rarity he is. Many die before passing the century mark, or worse still burn out and \nwithdraw from the struggle, too worn down or embittered to continue. A rare few sell \nout to the Man and become the enemy, though these rarely survive the ire of their \nformer comrades-in-arms, especially if they paid for their re-admittance with the \nblood of their old allies. Even the most dedicated anarchs often have a hard time \nwatching what happens to their treasured philosophies: Ideas that were radical in \ntheir youth become merely liberal to the next generation, moderate to the generation \nafter that and are positively conservative to mortals in the years that follow. Static \ncreatures that they are, few vampires adapt well to political and social progress. Those \nfew who do, however, become valuable assets to the Movement. \nCHAPKR THPJL: THE R E B ~  \nUNLIR \n73 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nHow sad, then, that such march elders are so seldom trusted by their far younger peers \nwhofearthemasspies,ag~povaxtarorworse.Onone \nhand,theygenerallyhavethesawir \nfaire to know what will and what won’t work in virtually any situation and the resouTces to \nbankroll grand operations. On the other, by this time they almost always have accumulated \na long list of enemies as old and as powerful as they are, if not more so. Even those whose \nreputations are beyond reproach occasionally find it difficult to retain allies among the \nneonates for whom they fight, who look on them as “out of touch” with the ideals of the day \nor even as likely sell-outs to the sects. Not that there isn’t some truth to these fears -no one \nwants to serve as cannon fodder, and in a clash between elders, a neonate can be little else. \nANARCHY \nBY GFNFRATION \nGiven the relative “youth” of most anarchs, it comes as little surprise that they \nare generally more thin-blooded compared to their sect rivals: Neonates of the \nthirteenth, twelfth and eleventh generations are the rule. That does not mean no \nanarchs of lower generation exist, though the upper ranks of the anarchs entertain \nsome curious habits when dealing with their high-generation comrades. One reason \nthese elders fear their younger counterparts is diablerie, as many of them became \n“elders by blood” during the Great Revolt when they fell upon their sires. Originally \nthey justified diablerie as an act of war against their oppressors; over half a \nmillennium later, they now find themselves in much the same situation as their sires \nonce did. They ponder the abuses and indignities that once drove them to such \nextremes, and fear their own childer might turn on them one day in similar fashion. \nAfter all, many modern anatchs still consider diablerie a fitting punishment in some \ninstances, and while it is far from condoned by the Movement as a whole, it is not \nunheard of either. It is very foolish to assume a young anarch must be a weak anarch. \nIn similar fashion to those vampires who have been with the anarchs for a long \ntime, thoseknown tobeoflow generation-whetheras theresult ofdiablerieorsimply \nbeing Embraced by an elder sire - \ntend to attract a lot of unwelcome attention. For \none thing, their peers in the other sects know precisely how dangerous those of strong \nblood are when they attain full command of their gifts, and thus will stop at nothing \nto deny such a potentially powerful asset to the rebellious neonates. And while their \ncomrades may respect their raw power, they are often viewed with much the same \nsuspicion as long-time members receive, as their fellow anarchs keep a close eye on \nthem in case it looks like they may turn to the enemy. Thus, their presence in the \nMovement is something of a two-edged sword. Though powerful individually, their \ncomrades aren’t likely to be as tough and therefore are less likely to survive the attacks \nmeant to destroy them. And since they haven’t been around as long as a true elder, they \noften lack the influence and resources to protect themselves against such attacks in the \nfirst place. Small wonder, then, that these jinxes find allies few and far between. \nANARCH~RY \nCLAN \nAs perhaps befits their origins at the Convention of Thorns, the majority of \nanarchs trace their lineage back to one of the Camarilla’s founding clans. This is not \nto say that these are the only clans in evidence, of course - \nthere are a number of \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n14 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAssamite, Ravnos, Setite and even a very small number of Lasombra anarchs out there \nas well. Even some of the rare bloodlines have found a place in the ranks of the \nrevolutionaries, though none to such a degree that they have had a widespread impact \non the Movement. Indeed, with the exception of the highly insular and vicious \nTzimisce and Giovanni clans, which go out of their way to hunt down and destroy all \nof their blood who dare to join the anarchs, no clan or bloodline is truly safe from having \nrogue members. Some produce more than others, but any vampire can “go anarch” - \nand will when pushed far enough. The Movement is not a clan phenomenon, it is a \nvampire phenomenon. Every family has children who strain at the leash. \nAnother common reason that causes neonates to spurn the traditional ways of \ntheir clans is, not surprisingly, too much pressure from their sires to be a proper little \nfill-in-the-blank in the first place. A Gangrel whose Brujah buddy taught him \nCelerity and Potence, for example, might think Fortitude and Protean are fair gifts to \nteach in return regardless of what some elder might have to say about the sanctity of \n“Ennoia’s Gift.” A Setite might think Sutekh‘s dark crusade to corrupt the world is \nsheer insanity and flee the cult at her first opportunity; Assamites might react the \nsame way to Haqim’s jyhad. Any vampire from a clan known to manipulate its \nneonates more than others might decide “toeing the clan line” is a waste of time; the \nsame goes for any neonate whose sire goes too far in trying to break her into accepting \nthe cruel truths of undead society. Life as an anarch is rough, but at least it’s ji-ee. \nCOMINGTOTHFMOVFMFNT \nANARCHS \nBY CHOICE \nThe overwhelming majority of anarchs come to the Movement of their own free will. \nFor most, it was a simple choice: spend immortality at the table waiting for the master to toss \nyou a bone, or smke out on your own. Self-respect is a powerful motivating force. Anarchs, \nfor all their faults, at least live on their feet. They very rarely have much and what they do \nhave, they had to fight claw and fang to get. They grouse a great deal about how the elders \ncontrolall the besthuntinggrounds, andhow they want to redistribute theresourcesofcities \nfairly, but this isn’t the true cause of their rebellion. In the end, when all the political and \neconomic argument is over, the propagandists have run out of rhetoric and the time finally \ncomes for absolute honesty - \nat that moment, it’s all about self-respect. \nYes, most anarchs are quite young, but there are a few elders who are still in the \nfight and have been since the 14th century. There are even more ancillae who have \nbeen in it for a quite a while themselves. Yes, most anarchs are thin-bloods, but more \nthan a few have drawn“c1oser to Caine”or have beenclose all along. Yes, there are some \ncommon clans involved, but in the end nearly every clan is represented in the \nMovement, even the stodgiest and most structured. Yes, the Camarilla is the obkious \ntarget and provides the greatest number ofrecruits, but even independent clans and the \nSabbat can push their neonates too far. Given this evidence, even elders themselves \noccasionally repent of their crimes and join the Movement. So long as sects catering \nto elder power and privilege exist, there will always be anarchs to fight them. \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE RIBEL UNLIFE \n75 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nANARCHSRY \nACCIDFNT \nSome poor bastards end up in the Movement -at \nleast at first - \nagainst their \nwill. Perhaps a rival framed her for a fight in Elysium last month and she’s only two \nsteps ahead of the sheriff. Perhaps she offended the wrong elder and now finds herself \nstripped of even her Acknowledged standing in the eyes of the prince. Perhaps she ran \nafoul of the scourge before she could even find the prince. Whatever her reason, she \nlanded on the wrong side of the law, and she had nowhere else to go. \nIt happens. In fact, it happens so often that it’s something of a joke among many \nwho swear almost every anarch has a sob story about how the Man did him wrong. It \ndefinitely happens often enough for established anarchs to be wary of such converts, \nand rightly so. Most vampires on the run don’t consider themselves anarchs, and they \ngo right back to the enemy when their particular problem is solved. Worse, some may \neven try to take along a former ally as proof of their repentance. \nSome do stay, however, not least because they find themselves in the company \nof others who can understand what happened to them and where they’re coming \nfrom. For all their many faults, anarchs still tend to be the most open and welcoming \ntoward new recruits of all the sects, and especially for younger vampires who still \nremember their breathing days, this candor and camaraderie can be a welcome thing \nindeed. When they had nowhere else to go, the Movement took them in and treated \nthem well-or at least better than theiroid“friends”0n theother sideofthepolitical \nfence. Such converts often prove the most loyal to and the most evangelical of the \ncause, rarely missing an opportunity to proselytize to other disaffected neonates who \nstill believe elder propaganda about “those foolish anarchs.” \nANARCHSRY \nMIRACLE \nThere are two cases of “accidental anarchs” so special, they deserve individual \nattention. Both are so rare, they almost qualify as urban legends, but both have occurred \non more than one occasion. The first case involves Sabbat refugees, while the second \ncase concerns elders who become “enlightened” and join the Anarch Revolt. \nSabbat Refugees \nThough the elders of the Sabbat certainly wish it were otherwise, the Vinculum \nis neither foolproof nor eternal. Nomadic packs seldom perform the Vaulderie with \nanyone outside their own circle, and weak Vinculums guarantee little in the way of sect \nloyalty. Even founded packs can’t be expected to have the bishop present for every \nobservance, much less the archbishop. Without repeated observances, even the \nstrongest bonds fade to insignificance. Herein lies the chance for a dissident to escape. \nNot every soldier in the Great Crusade is happy to have been drafted in the first \nplace. Many have harbored dreams of desertion from that first night, and many more \nwere loyal in the beginning but began to question their commitment after becoming \nmore familiar with the sect. All they need is an opportunity, and the Sabbat’s love \naffair with violence often provides one. When a pack is wiped out during a siege and \nthe survivors have little or no Vinculum to the bishop in command, they might think \nTHE ANARCH \n&ID[ \n76 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntwice before returning to headquarters. After all, they already know they’ll just be \nassigned to another pack and sent back to the front. \nUnder those circumstances, many flee the Sabbat and never look back, if for no \nother reason than the fear that a Wild Hunt might be gaining on them (and one \nusually is). They can’t take refuge in the Camarilla - \nnot that any would wanlr to - \nand they can’t go it alone, so they end up with the one group of vampires who also \ncommonly travel in “packs” and are usually damned good fighters: anarchs. Of \ncourse, their new allies are profoundly suspicious of them at first, and justifiably \nconcerned about exactly who might be coming to reclaim them, but they brinz with \nthem info and rare Disciplines too useful to be turned away. In time, the refugees \novercome the initial suspicions and prove themselves trustworthy. It is from such \nconverts as these that most “normal” anarchs learn that the elders of the Sabbat are \nno better than those of the Camarilla. \nEnlightened Elders \nSometimes, the propaganda actually works. Whether they were som’ewhat \nsympathetic to the cause in the first place, converted purely by argument or rnoved \nby the nobility of an anarch‘s personal sacrifice, some elders “see the light” and realize \nthe Movement makes a number of valid points. Of course, realizing that your enemy \nis the “good guy” is one thing; actually joining his side is quite another. Very few \nelders are willing to openly cross that line even if they have come to believe they \nshould- doing so would mean breaking the ties that have bound them for cenruries, \nand that is not an action to take lightly. But some do, and they can make all the \ndifference in the world. \nWhen neonates and ancillae switch sides, they face suspicion. When Sabbat \nrefugees switch sides, they face suspicion and considerable anxiety at the thought of \nthe direct danger that often dogs their heels. When elders of any sect switch sides, \nhowever, they face utter disbelief. Sure, many propagandists have called for the elders \nto surrender power peacefully - \nthat’s a standard and almost gratuitous lme of \nrhetoric in the speeches of emissaries and rabble-rousers worldwide. But it isn’t long \nbefore even the most optimistic recruiters generally abandon the idea of an elder \nactually doing it, so when it happens it must be a trick, some kind of ploy to set the \nanarchs up for a larger fall. Only a fool or a madman would trust someone willing to \ngive away centuries of progress and achievement, nght? \nWrong. Though certainly not all conversions have been genuine, occasionally \none is for real, and every time it happens the revolution takes one giant step toward \neventual victory. The sheer influence that such an elder brings with him staggers the \nimagination. Vampires are creatures of habit, elders most of all, and aconvertecl elder \ncan still claim prestation over those who owe him boons. You can accumulate a lot \nof boons in 700 years. Imagine an entire coterie of anarchs facing a blood hum: from \nan irate prince, then mysteriously being banished from his city instead. Why? Simple. \nThat prince is the elder’s grandchilde, and their benefactor just collected on a boon \nfrom 1637. Enlightened elders seldom get “in the trenches” - \nthat just wouldn’t be \nproper, you see - \nbut they serve in other more valuable ways, and those who come \nto trust them are grateful indeed for the aid they can offer. \nCHAFERTHREE: \nTHE REBEL UNLIR \n11 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPOLITICAL \nIMPULSFS \nIDEOLOGY \nAND MFTHODOLOGY \nTwo of the most fundamental questions in modern political theory are “HOW do \nwe strike the proper balance between securing individual liberty on one hand and \nsecuring social order on the other?” and “What is the most efficient and moral way to \naccomplish social change?” Most vampires, however, see only the extremes of this \ndebate - \non the one side is the Camarilla, which quite obviously values social order \nabove individual liberty. On the other side, the Sabbat just as clearly values individual \nliberty above social order, to the point of permitting a certain amount of divisive \nfeuding rather than laying down law from above. While exceptional territories may see \nthings differently, as a rule vampires can expect the same thing in every territory ruled \nby the major sects - \nthe only difference is in the degree to which it is enforced. \nBy contrast, the Anarch Revolt occupies the proverbial middle ground between \nthe two sects. It does not do this by representing a single moderate viewpoint, \nhowever, nor do its members follow a uniform policy regarding acceptable forms of \nresistance to the status quo. Indeed, to their sectarian counterparts, “typical” anarch \nideology is a study in apparent contrasts: Most anarchs share the Sabbat’s desire for \nvampires to be free from elder rule, but also see merit in the Camarilla’s design for \nmaintaining an overall social order and avoiding a second Inquisition. Capable of \nembracing what they like from both sects while rejecting those parts they find \nrepellent, as well as injecting an amount of mortal political thought or their own ideas \ninto the mix, the anarchs take great pride in finding a better way to govern \nthemselves. Perhaps the greatest gift the Movement allows its anarchs is the freedom \nto explore issues of governance for themselves, gaining glory or suffering the \nconsequences as appropriate to the particular social experiment they endorse. \nWhat follows, then, is an overview of the ideological spectrum found within the \nMovement, from the subtle aid and encouragement of the loyal opposition within \nthe Camarilla to the mindless violence of the nihilists who exist simply to bring chaos \nand disorder to Kindred and kine alike. While these summaries represent a good \nsampling of the political impulses observed among the anarchs, it should be \nremembered that they are far from all-inclusive: A hardcore nihilist may still cling \nto a few shreds of constructionist hopes, for instance. Likewise, they are not overtly \nrecognized among the ranks of the Movement - \none does not walk up to another \nanarch and ask “Are you a Reformer?” any more than one would ask “What’s your \nNature?” While some political scholars and philosophers could in fact identify these \nideologies at work, they are not common lingo among the anarchs themselves. \nIt should also be noted that these impulses are largely predicated on opposition \nto the Camarilla and/or furthering the goals of the anarchs themselves. While the \nSabbat is certainly a concern for the anarchs, only the most irrational vampires hold \nany hope of persuading the Sabbat to change its ways short of destroying the sect \nentirely. Individual Sons and Daughters of Caine may be targeted for recruitment by \nanarch advocates, but as a whole the fanatical devotion of the sect and its fundamen- \nTHE ANARCH \nG~IDE \n18 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntalist faith in the sincerity of its mission mean that few anarchs waste any time \npreaching to the Sword ofCaine. At least with the Camarilla, there’ssome hope they \nwill listen to reason - \nwith the Sabbat, the best one can hope for is to escape before \nthe zealots decide to do some recruiting of their own.. . . \nTHF LOYAL \nOPPOSITION \nThese factions represent the liberal extremes of acceptable thought and tlehav- \nior in the Camarilla. Very few of these factions consider themselves to be “an,xchs” \nin any sense of the term, though they may well be labeled as such by their peers. Some \ncontinue to support these positions even if forced outside the Camarilla mainstream, \nsupporting the ideals of their estranged sect even if it has rejected them, while 13thers \ndo their best to remain “in the belly of the beast” where they feel they can do more \ngood. Of all the anarch impulses, these three are the most likely to find themselves \nforced into the arms of the Movement not because they wish to join, but because they \nare kicked out of the sect by those who fear their ideas. All of these types prefer to \nwork within the letter of Camarilla law when possible, but are quite willing to bend \nthe spirit of that law when necessary to achieve results. Such is politics, after all. \nC~YM~ATHIZFRS \nSympathizers are Camarilla loyalists who wholeheartedly support the sect in \ntheory, but hold many strong reservations regarding the abuses of the c L,y stem \ncommon among so many of its elders. Most are young elders themselves. They will \nsupport a just prince. However, they typically view that prince as “first among equals” \nand believe a very strong primogen council should check his power. They actively \noppose any prince who exercises his royal authority too often or too strongly, and they \nsympathize with ancillae and neonates who suffer beneath such despotism (hence \nthe term defining them). \nSympathizers are not true anarchs, though their reactionary peers might label \nthem as such. They generally react to an arrogant prince by quietly leveraging him \nfrom the throne and installing a more lenient successor. They believe the Camarilla \nis a viable sect so long as elders wield their influence with wisdom and a reasonable \ndegree of noblesse oblige. Their attitude toward ancillae and neonates remains one of \npaternal condescension. While they agree with anarchs on many issues, sympa1:hizers \nbelieve these angry and dreadfully ill-mannered young rebels present their case very \npoorly indeed. Believing the system works when vampires make it work, they \ncondemn the actions of anarchs who resort to violence and consider such hoclligans \nto be little better than spoiled brats throwing temper tantrums. \nSympathizers work almost exclusively through prestation, calling in the odd \nfavor here and there in order to achieve a personal goal. They will occasionally use \ntheir considerable influence in a way that benefits a local anarch, but only rarely will \nthey do so in a way that establishes an actual link between them. Any who boasted \nof having received such assistance would surely never receive similar help in the \nfuture. Sympathizers, though liberal-minded, are elders nonetheless. They take \npropriety very seriously. \nCHAPERTHREE: \nTHE REBEL UNLIFI \n79 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nREFORMERS \nReformers are loyalists who still grudgingly support the Camarilla in theory but \nobject to its anachronistic structure in practice. Most are very young elders or older \nancillae who suffer a prince to rule over them only as a figurehead. They chafe at the \nvery thought of so much power vested in a single individual. True power, they ardently \nassert, should rest in the primogen council. Many would prefer to see the office ofprince \neliminated entirely but realize the tactical necessity of a single executive decision- \nmaker. Some have even gone so far as to claim primogen should be elected by their \nclans, and princes should be elected likewise by the primogen council. \nReformers insist they have the best interests of the sect in mind. Times and ways have \nchanged, they argue, so the sect must change with them if it is to survive. They believe the \nCamarilla can avoid eventual dissolution only if the elders peacefully surrender their \nmonopolyonpower. Likesympathizers, mostreformersdonotconsider themselves anarchs, \nbut many elders find reformers rather subversive; even sympathizers regard them as liberal \nsince reformers seldom echo the condemnation of violent resistance quite as loudly or as \noften as their more conservative peers. If their efforts are particularly successful at upsetting \nthe local order, they may find themselves labeled as anarchs and disowned by the Camarilla. \nReformers are careful to distance themselves from self-avowed anarchs in public \nlest their critics tar them with the same brush. In private, however, most reformers \ntolerate and occasionally actively support anarchs so long as the latter refrain from \npressing their extremist points of view. Like sympathizers, reformers prefer to work \nthrough prestation and other connections to achieve their goals. They are less likely \nto conceal their motives, however, since they are already known for “rocking the boat,” \nand they are fur more likely to broker the occasional “shady deal” when more honest \nmeans fail. For reformers, propriety occasionally takes a back seat to practicality. \nCONSTRUCTIONISTC~ \nConstructionists are the first of many who bear the label “anarch” whether they \naccept it or not. They are primarily (though not exclusively) composed of ancillae \nwho have lost faith in the Camarilla and rare older neonates who never had any in \nthe first place. Believing the sect is doomed to collapse from the weight of its own \nstagnation, they wish to not only construct a viable alternative but actually have it \nin place and ready to assume control when the inevitable finally occurs. Construc- \ntionists avoid open conflict with elders, but defend themselves aggressively when \nthey have no other option. For the most part, they maintain a very low profile, \nworking on their theories and quietly recruiting others to support their vision. \nConstructionists are old enough to have amassed a respectable amount of power \nfor themselves and they see no reason to risk their hard-won gains in aviolent rebellion. \nThey do not think of themselves as anarchs. They are more evolutionary than \nrevolutionary, but elders dismiss them as anarchs anyway. Constructionists envision a \nwide variety of alternative systems, but most agree that a loose confederation of city- \nstates ruled by representative councils would best meet the needs of future generations. \nThe only substantive difference between reformers and constructionists is the \nlatter’s rejection of a single unifying authority (that is, the Inner Circle and its \njusticars). Otherwise, they are virtually identical in ideals and methods. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n80 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHF DISLOYAL \nOPPO~ITION \nThese factions represent the true heart and soul of the Anarch Movement. They are \nthe first to espouse beliefs truly and unequivocally outside the accepted norm and, as a \nresult, the first to suffer active opposition from the elders. In turn, they are the first to call \nthemselves “anarchs” and the first to resort to methods of revolt beyond Camarilla “law.” \nReformers or constructionists might be forced into the Movement simply because no one \nelse will listen to them, but members who adhere to these impulses embrace their \noppositional stance from the very beginning. Loyalists are trying to save the Camarilla \nfrom itself or replace it with a similar structure, while the Disloyalists have forsaken the \nCamarilla and anything like it in favor of seeking something else entirely. While the \nMovement would suffer without the actions of the Loyal Opposition to support its efforts \nfrom time to time, without these impulses it might very well cease to exist. \n RADICAL^ \nRadicals, as a group, espouse beliefs so far outside the accepted vampiric norm \nthat many elders consider them utterly mad. Most radicals are neonates who rejpect \nonly individual achievement regardless of age, generation or clan. To them, age \ndoesn’t always grant wisdom, generation only defines the limits of superna tural \npotency and clan is merely a sociological distinction about as meaningful (or \nmeaningless) as handedness, hair color or musical taste. Some radicals even go .So far \nas to renounce any clan affiliation, becoming self-declared Caitiff. \nRadicals have a more “universalist” view than their militant comrades. Whereas \nmilitants are usually concerned only with their home areas, radicals who succes:;fully \nliberate one city often forego the boring process of consolidating their hold on power \nin order to export the revolution to neighboring cities. While they aren’t so foolish \nas to disavow violence altogether, radicals prefer to use nonviolent methods of \nspreading their ideas whenever possible, believing that in the long term such efforts \nhave a much greater potential payoff than violence. Devotion to the struggle is their \nparamount concern, not government or military action. This impulse provides the \nMovement with many of its most gifted political thinkers but very few tacticians, \nthough they make fierce (if not particularly efficient) front line fighters when called \nupon. Radicals occasionally win the war only to lose the peace. \nGenerally the youngest of anarchs, radicals are by far the most idealistic. Many \nwere activists and firebrands as mortals and simply brought their politics with them \ninto undeath. Unfazed by the Embrace, they struggle to reshape vampire society \nalong socialist, communist, anarchist or other political lines. Believing the Camarilla \nto be teetering on the brink of dissolution, they dedicate themselves to pushing it \nover the edge by any means necessary. Given opportunity, they eagerly exploit \npolitical circumstances to their benefit. Lacking opportunity, they create it by \nstirring up the populace. Despite their relative youth, they are a force to fear. \nMILITANT5 \nAs their name implies, militants are strident in their opposition to elder rule. \nMost are neonates and very young ancillae. Like the constructionists, they believe \nthe Camarilla will self-destruct. Unlike the constructionists, they see no reason to \nCHAPTERTHREE: \nTHE RIBEL UNLIR \n81 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwait for that to happen on its own. Accordingly, militants seek to undermine the sect \nat every available opportunity, destabilizing individual domains in the hope of \nfomenting local rebellion. Despite rumors to the contrary, however, the name refers \nonly to their level of devotion and desire to take direct action - \nnot all militants \nemploy or even endorse violence and sabotage to achieve their goals. What defines \na militant is not a need to use force to solve problems, but the idea that some decisive \naction must be taken, and that such actions ultimately lie outside the scope of \nCamarilla law. This is also where their paths diverge from their radical comrades - \nwhile militants appreciate and often endorse a great deal of anarch ideology, they see \ndirect action as the only way to achieve lasting results. Speeches may make converts, \nbut victories make territories. \nMilitants generally support the idea of independent city-states ruled by repre- \nsentative councils, but see no reason to unify these city-states via a larger confederation \nas many radicals propose. Each city-state, they argue, should be free to deal with \nothers as it chooses based on individual inclination as well as the hard truths of \npolitical, military or economic need. Each territory should be sovereign in all \nrespects, its internal affairs considered sacrosanct against foreign interference, and \nempowered to resist those enemies who violate its sovereignty. \nMilitants expect aggression from elders for their resolute stance, and are almost \nalways ready to defend themselves and their communities with deadly force. They \nrecognize full well that compromise isn’t an option since there is no place in the \nCamarilla for them to occupy, and fight accordingly. Unlike constructionists, who \nwill generally peaceably cede their land rather than fight newcomers bent on \nconflict, militants do not turn the other cheek when something threatens their new \nutopia. Elders who represent a clear and present danger to a militant community, or \na significant obstacle to establishing one, might return to their havens one night to \nfind a heavily armed strike team waiting for them. \nHARDLINFRS \nHardliners are anarchs who have suffered greatly at the hands of sires, of sheriffs, \nof scourges, of princes. Hurt, bitter, filled with rage, they want to repay pain with \nagony. Like many other anarchs, hardliners believe the Camarilla is on its last legs \nand they want to be the ones who finally bring down the great beast for good. They \nwelcome violent confrontation on almost any terms, as means to prove their \ndevotion if not always to win battles. Unlike militants, they generally lack the \npatience to wait while the propagandists win the hearts and minds of the general \npopulace. They want their revolution, and they want it now, damn it! \nHardliners don’t just want to put the Camarilla on its knees; they want to kick it \nwhile it’sdown. They want to keep on kicking it until it begsfor mercy. Hardliners want \nthe elders to suffer all the misery and degradation that has been their lot. For many of \nthem, the struggle has nothing to do with making a better world. It’s all about getting \neven with those who wronged them. No more, no less. They might claim otherwise to \ntheir less embittered comrades - \nthey might even believe that lie themselves - \nbut \nthe sad truth is that they are more interested in revenge than justice. \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n82 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nConsequently, hardliners aren’t particularly concerned with complex ideologies \nand few give any thought to “what comes after.” All they truly care about is taking \nthe fight to the enemy and they aren’t particularly picky when choosing allies. .4 \nrare \nfew will cooperate with anyone if it means bringing down a hated elder. If the gang \nthat helped torch the bastard’s haven turned out to actually be a Sabbat pack, well, \nso what? The elder is dead; that’s all that matters. What revolutionary ideals they \nonce held may not be forgotten, but they are distant at best - \nuseful perhaps as a \nrallying cry, but not particularly important beyond a few bitter memories. \nTHF ANARCH \nFRINGF \nThese factions represent something of the dark underbelly of the Anarch \nMovement. While most of these groups are not truly connected to the Cause in any \nway, they are often equated with it by other vampires, and that makes them \nsomething of a concern to the anarchs whether they like it or not. This is not to say \nthat anarchs don’t occasionally find these groups useful or even outright ally with \nthem from time to time, just that as a whole anarch leaders do not consider them true \nparts of the Movement. Indeed, dealing with these groups often presents something \nof a conflict to the anarchs involved: On the one hand, these groups are committed \nto personal freedom and self-determination outside the sects, but at the same time \nnone are committed to any noble struggle for liberty and justice. \nA UTARCHS ( AUTARKI’S) \nAutarchs have a single political belief: they don’t do politics. They keep to \nthemselves, manage their own affairs and expect other vampires to do the same. They \navoid the company of other vampires lest they find themselves drawn into conflict \nof one form or another. Depending on the autarch in question, calling one an anarch \nmay even be considered fighting words - \nthese loners left everything behind to \navoid labels and social cliques, and aren’t too happy to have some punk try to do what \npressure from an entire sect couldn’t manage. While they may throw in with the \nanarchs from time to time out of common cause or mutual defense, that is about the \nextent of their involvement, and they like to keep it that way. Those who mistake \nan autarch‘s presence as indicative of some desire to join the Movement seldom make \nthe same mistake twice, one way or another. \nAt best, autarchs maintain strict neutrality, and deal with other vampires fairly \nif a bit distantly when the need requires. At worst, they feel little but contempt for \nthe Camarilla, the Sabbat and the Anarch Revolt alike, and take pleasure in showing \nsuch foolish vampires the error of their ways, painfully if necessary. Some aui-archs \nare quite young and hope to get older by not getting involved in politics, while some \nare far older than the sects they disdain, and so powerful that ignoring them and being \nignored in return has become the best option to continue with their arcane personal \nagendas. In either event, when they assume residence in a Camarilla domain, they \nseldom make more than a token appearance in front of the prince before disappearing \ninto the city or the outlying regions. Every autarch carries an aura of mystery and most \nlike it that way, to keep potential foes off guard if nothing else. \nCHA~ER \nTHREE THE ksit UNLIR \n83 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFor their part, few anarchs know what to make of autarchs. On one hand, autarchs \nare just doing what they want to do and it’s almost impossible for an anarch to criticize \nthat impulse without coming off like a total hypocrite. At the same time, many anarchs \nbelieve you’re either part of the problem or part of the solution, and autarch apathy is \ndefinitely seen as part of the problem. Thus, while few actually disk autarchs, few spare \nthem much sympathy either. While they may work together when the need requires, \nboth sides know better than to expect any lasting support. \nMFRCFNARIFS \nMercenaries, like autarchs, care nothing for either sect or the anarchs who seek to \nbring those sects down. Unlike autarchs, they readily involve themselves in political \nconflicts even though they have no political motives of their own, for the sake of a \npaycheck. Some uphold a rough code of honor, but most will sell their services to the \nhighest bidder. However, unlike some mortal mercenaries, they rarely switch alle- \ngiances once hired-doing \nso is aquick way to bring downall manner of unpleasantness \namong the Kindred. So long as their fees are paid in a timely manner, they serve their \nemployers faithfully. Mercenaries enjoy a strange dual status among vampires. Both \nelders and anarchs look down on them as social parasites but value them for their \nusefulness. They are seldom truly respected but often feared for their prowess. \nMercenaries, though not themselves interested in politics, are the source of \nconsiderable debate with those who are. Pragmatic militants and radicals see nothing \nwrong with bolstering battlefield strength with soldiers offortune, or consider doing so \ntheir only viable option given the strength of local opposition forces. Their more far- \nsighted - \nor more fanatical - \npeers may even believe all “liberation forces” should \nconsist exclusively of volunteers recruited from among “the People.” What good is a \nmilitary victory, they ask, if the people for whom you fought views you as the enemy? \nRound and round the debate goes, seemingly without end. For their part, mercenaries \nsimply don’t care. Conflict is business and, in the Movement, business is good. \nNIHILISTS \nNihilists are the black sheep of the anarch flock. Almost without exception, \nthey are brutal misfits less than thirty years undead who resent any limitations to their \npersonal freedom. They revel in their supernatural powers and usually have little or \nno concern for mortals. Their agenda, as far as they can honestly be said to have one, \nseems to be “party, party, party.” They don’t so much oppose elder rule as they oppose \nthe rule of whatever specific elder comes between them and their fun. \nNihilists are motivated by self-interest far more than any noble political \nideology. Most were criminals or problem children as mortals and simply continue \ntheir antisocial activity as vampires. Although they are a minority faction in the \nMovement, they call the most attention to themselves by their outrageous behavior. \nAs far as the rank and file of the Camarilla is concerned, all anarchs are nihilists. As \na result, nihilists find themselves fighting other anarchs as often and as savagely as \nthey fight princes, sheriffs or scourges. Indeed, some anarchs make it their personal \ncrusade to purge these hellions from the ranks of the Movement, and take every \nchance they can to destroy these immature undead at every turn. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n84 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRude, crude and arrogant, nihilists care little for the revolution. They feel no \nsense of solidarity and actively oppose any who would restrain them in any way. Brute \nforce is all they respect. The rare few who do not die violently within adecade of their \nEmbrace almost always join the Sabbat. Indeed, there is often precious little to \ndistinguish nihilist gangs from Sabbat packs other than an absence of the Vaulderie. \nAll that stands between many nihilist gangs and the Sword of Caine is a cha1ic:e and \na sermon. \nANARCH \nIDEALS \nTo best understand what anarchs believe, one must first present the pivotal heliefs \nespoused by the Camarilla and the Sabbat and then consider the typical anarch \nresponse to those beliefs. It should be understood, however, that as with many rhings \nthis generalization of a “typical” anarch response is just that: a generalization. Ariarchs \nmay have widely different opinions and interpretations of these concepts beirween \ndiffering factions and even different individuals within the same faction, depending on \ntheir own personal histories and experiences. Accordingly, readers are advised to take \nthese summaries with a grain of salt before assuming that any particular anarch holds \nthe same opinions as expressed here. When especially relevant, particular factional \nobjections or interpretations have been described below. \nTHF CAMARILLA \nAs the undeniably dominant sect of vampire society, the Camarilla embodies \nthe very system anarchs strive to change. Thus, as the “laws” of that sect, the Six \nTraditions and the manner in which elders interpret and enforce them inspire the \ngreatest amount of dissident thought. \nTHE \nFIRST TRADITION: \nMASQUERADE \nOnly the most foolish or fanatical vampires deny the wisdom of hiding their very \nexistence from the teeming masses of humanity. Accordingly, almost no anarch \nobjects to the Masquerade as a general theory. Instead, they find fault in its most \ncommon application and enforcement. Considering the sophistication of modern \nforensic science and the astounding speed with which it advances, the policy of \nhiding the existence of all vampires from mortals strikes most as nothing short of \npatently absurd. Sooner or later, they believe, irreversible discovery by a government \nagency is unavoidable. \nFaced with the manifest impossibility of the Masquerade as an absolute secret, \nsome radicals propose a revolutionary but pragmatic solution: actively enlisting \nmortal aid. Selective revelation to key mortals, they argue, creates a safety net of \ninformed agents who hide vampires from mass discovery far better than they alone \ncan hide themselves. Properly administered and applied on a global scale, such an \nenlightened policy would pave the way for social acceptance of the undead when the \nMasquerade completely collapses. (And it will collapse, these same theorists insist; \nto them, failing to plan for that night is criminal stupidity.) \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \na5 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMost elders consider this approach utterly insane and ruthlessly exterminate all \nanarchs who put it into practice at any level. In their experience, the Masquerade as an \nabsolute secret is all that saved them from the fires of the Inquisition and all that stands \nbetween them and a second fiery holocaust. That secret must be kept at all costs. Mortals \n- \nany and all mortals -must remain ignorant of the monsters in their midst. Any vampire \nwho reveals the truth, whether by accident or design, must die as a lesson to others. \nElders enforce this “zero tolerance” policy so zealously that mere suspicion of \nviolation is enough to send most anarchs to greet the sun, as well as guarantee the \ndeath of their mortal associates. Better to be safe, the elders claim, than sorry. This, \naccording to the elders, is the wisdom of ages. This, according to the visionaries, is \nthe folly of inflexibility. Unable to adapt to the changing world, the elders cling \nferociously to tradition and thereby steer a direct course to what many radicals \nconsider an easily avoided doom. Ruthlessly executing those suspected of selective \nrevelation only makes matters worse. \nOn the other hand, anarchs themselves are just as brutal when handling what \nthey consider serious breaches of the Masquerade. Training a core group of trusted \nretainers to help maintain the illusion of normalcy is acceptable. Telling the entire \ndowntown party posse at a favorite club is not. Careless or casual displays of \nsupernatural power are out of the question. Real anarchs are many things, but stupid \nisn’t on the list, and wantonly spreading such dangerous information is as serious to \nthem as it is to the enemy. They understand and help conceal the occasional honest \nmistake, but a cavalier attitude toward the Big Secret is a guaranteed way to make \nenemies. Making enemies is a guaranteed way to mysteriously disappear. What \nprince will even care about amissing anarch, let alone waste valuable resources trying \nto find him? And if word on the street has it the missing moron broke the Masquerade \nprior to his disappearance, perhaps it is best for all concerned that he remainmissing. \nTHF \n~ F C O N D  TRADITION: \nDOMAIN \nDisagreement over the Second Tradition is perhaps the most fundamental issue \nof the Anarch Revolt, with the possible exception of the Fifth (see below). Again, \nit is a matter of theory versus application. To anarchs, a claim of domain over your \nhaven makes perfect sense. A prince’s claim of domain over an entire metropolis with \na million or more mortal inhabitants makes absolutely no sense at all. \nElders who were Embraced during the Middle Ages might be comfortable with \nfeudalism, but few vampires Embraced within the last three centuries truly agree with \nthe practice. The notion of “natural rights” is too much apart of their thinking, and one \nof those rights is the right to your own property, not just to hold land as a fief granted \nby one’s liege lord. Reformers, constructionists and militants are the foremost propo- \nnents of liberal politics in vampire society. They prefer to divide a metropolis equitably \namong its residents so that each resident has, if not a totally equitable share, at least \nenough room to rest and feed in safety without imposing on another’s territory. \nOf course, many radicals reject this solution as being little better than the \nfeudalism it replaces. There is no way to divide ametropolis equitably, they argue. Try \nas you might, someone always receives a domain clearly inferior to the domains ofhis \nTHE ANARCH hlDL \n86 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nneighbors. Also, a one-time division makes no allowance for changes in the resident \npopulation. How should the current population accommodate new residents who \narrive after the initial division of the city? And most importantly, individual domains \npresent a difficult challenge to the Masquerade. If the same vampire hunts in the \nsame part of the city over the course of several decades, her true nature will inevitably \nbe revealed by an accumulation of evidence linking her to bizarre incidents and \noccasional assaults. To protect the Masquerade, residents must violate each other’s \ndomains. Clearly, radicals conclude, private domains are a threat to individual liberty \nbecause they create the conditions of inequity whence arises violence between the \nhaves and the have-nots. \nLiberals believe that free trade between property owners ultimately redresses \nsuch problems, but radicals contend that free trade only results in the concentration \nof more and more property in the hands of ever fewer owners. You cannot safeguard \nindividual liberty, they claim, by increasing the inequities that cause violence \nbetween individuals. Accordingly, radicals establish collective domains wherein \nmost of the city is considered the common property of all. Individuals are free to hunt \nwithin these “public reserves” so long as they keep the Masquerade. \nThe practice has so far met with only limited success in the smallest anarch \ncommunities. In the larger communities, nihilist gangs often claim turf and refuse \nhunting privileges to non-members unless paid some outlandish “tribute.” Sadly \nenough, disputes of this nature are almost always resolved violently. \nTHE THIRD \nTRADITION: \nPROGENY \nAmong anarchs, popular opinion holds that elders restrict the siring of progeny \nto maintain their grip on the reins of power. They only allow the Embrace of chlilder \nwho can be counted on to be good little fledglings and toe the party line. Since the \nprivilege of siring is so rarely doled out, and vampires Embraced without a prince’s \nofficial sanction are destroyed along with their sires, the younger generations cannot \ngrow numerous enough to pose a significant threat to the elders who oppress them. \nNeedless to say, anarchs oppose this policy as a violation of a natural right. Like \nmortal procreation, they see vampiric siring as an inalienable vampiric right. \nThe problem is that things aren’t quite that simple. Sure, elders want to prevent \na surge in the neonate population. Sure, they want to ensure the loyalty of the neonates \nwhose Embrace they permit. However, there’s more to the matter than protecting their \nhegemony. Cities are crowded enough already. Every new vampire is one more \ncompetitor for prey. W h y  create competition for the limited resources that vampires \nalready fight so savagely over? If everyone were allowed to Embrace on a whim, the \nresulting overpopulation would wreck the Masquerade and thereby condemn the \nentire vampiric race to extinction. Where would the Anarch Movement be then? \nMost older anarchs realize this. In practice, comparatively few sire progeny with \nsuch callous disregard for the Big Picture. Unfortunately for the responsible majority, \nit only takes a single bad apple to spoil the bunch, and when it comes to such an \napparently obvious “right” as siring even well-meaning anarchs can make terrible \nmistakes. The youngest and angriest can’t see past the ends of their attitudes. More \nCHAFER THREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n81 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\noften than not, their sires weren’t the best judges of potential childer and neither are \nthey. Nihilists are the worst offenders; some will Embrace a mortal who just served \nas dinner for no other reason than “the dude put up a damned good fight.” \nThe situation is serious and grows worse with each passing night. Something \nmust be done soon, but anarch leaders have severely limited options. Strict enforce- \nment of this Tradition is out of the question (the popular uproar would be deafening \n- \nand deadly). Both liberals and radicals struggle to indoctrinate their peers with a \nsense of social responsibility and a solid grasp of basic food chain economics, but this \nis astopgap measure at best. Many in the Movement are justifiablyworried. If anarchs \ncan’t resolve this issue, it will get completely out of hand - \nand either the elders or, \nworse, the humans will solve it for them. \nTHE FOURTH \nTRADITION: \nACCOUNTING \nThis Tradition also directly contradicts a fundamental belief shared by almost \nall anarchs: just as every individual is free, every individual is responsible for what he \ndoes with his freedom. It is the epitome of injustice to punish one vampire for the \nactions of another unless coercion can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. \nAnarchs seldom punish a sire for the behavior of his childe. They punish the childe \ninstead. A vampire who habitually sires problematic progeny, however, is an entirely \ndifferent matter. One or two dangerous childer represent honest mistakes. Five or six \nrepresent criminal negligence, and anarchs punish such negligence accordingly. In \nall cases, sires are expected to help apprehend wayward childer and hand them over \nfor punishment. \nAdditionally, anarchs do not release their childer into vampire society, much \nless command them in all things. Too many experienced long years of servitude spent \nindentured to their own sires to ever put their childer through such nonsense. They \nteach their childer, of course, and the wisest and most responsible sires teach their \nchilder well, but they do not treat their childer like servants. Many Embrace only \nmortal friends, allies and retainers to whom they’ve already taught the basics. \nTHE FIFTH \nTRADITION: \nHOSPITALITY \nDespite accusations to the contrary, anarchs understand manners. They don’t \nbarge into each other’s havens uninvited and they conduct themselves with reason- \nable decorum while staying under another’s roof. That’s just common courtesy. \nPresenting themselves to aprince whenever they go from city to city is ridiculous and \nfew do so unless they truly fear the scourge. Again, it is an issue of natural rights (in \nthis case, the right to move from place to place without undue hindrance). That, \nhowever, is actually a relatively minor point of contention. The part that truly \noffends all anarchs is the line about being nothing without the word of acceptance. \nWhy? Simple. No prince is obligated to grant his “word of acceptance” to anyone. He \nhas the power to confirm or deny a vampire’s legal existence on a whim, and there \nexists no law to secure natural rights against misuse of that authority. This Tradition \nasserts that vampires have no rights at all, merely privileges, and they have only such \nprivileges as the prince chooses to grant. It’s a prime example of medieval thinking \nfrom medieval minds, and anarchs don’t like it. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n88 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHF SIXTH \nTRADITION: \nDESTRUCTION \nAnarch attitudes toward this Tradition are characterized by extreme cynicism. \nWith the Third Tradition, elders reserve the authority to bring new vampires into \nthe world. With the Sixth, they reserve the authority to take vampires out of the \nworld. Many doubt elders ever concern themselves much with the departed since, as \nthe saying goes, they can make many more just like the ones they destroyed. If the \nprince gives the word, that’s it - \nno appeal, no second chance, just destruction. It’s \nall far too arbitrary for anarchs because few princes ever bother to truly invesirigate \nthe crimes for which they so often call blood hunts. A rumor here, an innuendo there \nand suddenly the entire city is on your case. If you’re lucky, you manage to get out of \ntown before the sheriff tracks you down. If not, well, it was nice knowing you. \nAnarchs prefer a little bit more due process than that. At the very least, the \naccused is permitted to give his side of the story. Leaders are expected to invesirigate \nthe circumstances surrounding the alleged offense, and to report their findings to the \ncommunity. Some communities trust their leaders to determine guilt or innocence. \nOthers prefer a public trial. Punishment usually fits the crime, and some communities \nprefer banishment to destruction. Many anarchs believe penalties should be rehabili- \ntative rather than punitive. On the other hand, some idiots and malcontents just \nneed killing, and few object when a self-aggrandizing “revolutionary” who threatens \nto bring needless misery on anarchs everywhere is put down for the common good. \nCAMARILLAJUSTICE \nTo anarchs, there is no “justice” in the Camarilla, there’s “just us’’ against an old, \nentrenched, insane and power-mad “them.” The sect considers criminal those things \nto which anarchs feel entitled and the whole of Camarilla “justice” is geared toward \nkeeping things just the way they are. Worse, an innocent can be convicted of a so- \ncalled “crime” on nothing more than the word of a sufficiently influential elder, and \nwhat elder isn’t influential in the extreme compared to a neonate? \nIt’s bad enough knowing you can be put to Final Death on a whim, but the \nindignity hardly ends there. Other punishments exist that, while lenient in elder eyes, \nare infinitely worse to an anarch. One is being returned to your sire as an unreleased \nchilde (“Apparently, he failed to learn his lessons the first time; see that he does not \nfail again”). Another is being forced into blood slavery to the prince (“I trust, with your \nnewfound devotion to my safety, we have seen the last of your pathetic tantrum?“). \nAmong anarchs, the phrase “Camarilla justice” is an oxymoron. There can be no justice \nin the sect; its very existence is a crime against vampires everywhere. \nTHF SARRAT \nTechnically, the Sabbat is just a very large faction of the Anarch Movement. It is \nan astoundingly sick and twisted faction, of course, but it is still part of the drive to abolish \nelder rule. Ideologically, some strong similarities exist between the two: the commitment \nto destroy the Camarilla, the willingness to follow only those leaders who continually \nprove themselves, even to some extent the emphasis on combat proficiency and war \nparties. Some converts from the Sabbat have even gone so far as to describe unlife in an \nanarch gang as “Sabbat Lite” - \nall the camaraderie, none of the dogma. \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n89 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThere are other differences, however, that prevent the anarchs and the Sabbat \nfrom ever seeing eye to eye in anything but the most immediate and necessary terms. \nMost encounters between anarch gangs and Sabbat packs result in a straight-up brawl \nwith no quarter asked and none given. For while their fundamental goals may be \nsimilar, in practice the unholy rites of the Sabbat and their disregard for the unlives \nof their individual members in favor of the glory of the sect are anathema to anarchs. \nThough information on the inner workings of the sect is scant at best, modem \nanarchs have learned enough to know the Sword of Caine is not a viable alternative \nto the Camarilla. It appeals only to the most sociopathic of nihilist thugs, and \nmainstream anarchs consider them a lost cause anyway. For the vast majority, \nregardless of faction, in the end there is no dissent: The Sabbat is the enemy, clearly \nand unequivocally. \nRFJFCTING HUMANITY \nWhile anarchs in general are more receptive to new and different ideas than \nmost Camarilla loyalists, and perhaps more likely to follow (or at least aspire to \nfollow) Paths of Enlightenment despite their relative youth, there is a difference \nbetween accepting one’s vampiric nature and reveling in it. Anarchs know they aren’t \nhuman anymore, but very few believe this automatically entitles them to be absolute \nmonsters. Frenzy must be mastered, not indulged. What good does it do to escape \noutside oppression if you remain a slave to the Beast within? \nCAINITE \nSUPREMACY \nLikewise, most anarchs - \neven the rare few who follow Paths - \nreject the idea \nthat “not human” equals “superior to humans,” at least in a moral sense. Superior in \nterms of raw ability, yes; even the lowliest of neonates soon manifest powers that are \ngodlike when compared to mortals. But being stronger, faster, tougher or in any other \nway superior to mortals in performance does not grant a vampire the right to treat \nthem like mere cattle. As a general rule, mainstream anarchs treat mortals with \nrespect, if not as individuals then at least as a whole. To them, it is the ultimate \nhypocrisy to treat mortals in ways they refuse to accept from their own elders. \nPROMI~ES \nOF FREEDOM \nHappiness inslavery, the saying goes- and that’s exactly what the Sabbat gives. \nThe Vaulderie merely replaces a bond to one with a bond to many. Where, anarchs \nask, is the freedom in that? They hear the promises of freedom, but most know those \npromises are lies. It’s a tough sell for even the most silver-tongued of rogues, and the \nanarchs aren’t buying. Even most nihilists, who seldom retain much of their \nHumanity anyway, balk at the Vinculum. They know a leash when they see one. \nWAR AGAINST THE ANCIENTS \nSomewhere, somehow, the Sabbat went astray into religion and never came \nback. Few anarchs truly believe in the Antediluvians, and those who do simply aren’t \nconcerned about them. After all, if nuclear weapons haven’t roused them from \ntorpor, they must be down for the count. The problem, as anarchs see it, isn’t the \nsemi-mythical slumbering Ancients; it’s the very real and active elders who control \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n90 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe society the Movement exists to change. Apocalyptic millennia1 fears be darnned; \nthere’s a revolution to be fought, not some fanatical holy war! No dedicated anarch \nhas time to worry about Gehenna. \nOTHFR \nIssues \nFFFDING \nAnarchs are no different from other vampires when it comes to feeding. :Some \nhunt as predators, others steal as thieves. Some prefer the Casanova way, others \nprefer the Sandman method. Some restrict themselves to animals, others are lucky \nenough to have a human herd. The difference is that unlike Camarilla loyalists, \nanarchs rarely have permission to feed whenever and wherever they get their meals, \nand this makes them poachers as far as the elders are concerned. Thus, the primary \nfeeding concern for most anarchs is knowing on which elder’s domain they are \npoaching, how to avoid being caught and just how that elder is likely to react when \n- \nand it’s a very frequent “when” - \nthey’re busted. \nMore often than not, elders extort some service from the offenders and let the \nmatter drop. Poaching is such a minor infraction that it’s just not worth the time lor the \ntrouble to make a big deal over a few pathetic upstarts sneaking a sip or three when they \nthought no one was looking. Occasionally, however, elders crack down hard, particu- \nlarly on repeat offenders. The last thing an elder can afford to do is look weak, because \nthat motivates his rivals to move on his assets. Sometimes, despite all precautioms, an \nanarch simply picks the wrong night to hunt in the wrong part of town. The next thing \nhe knows, he’s standing before the prince with a furious elder demanding his head. \nIncidents like this underscore the urgency of anarch demands for the equal \ndistribution of a city’s resources. Vampires must feed, they argue; deny blood. long \nenough and the Hunger will drive them to frenzy. They don’t want to poach on an \nelder’s domain, they have to. In this regard, anarchs find themselves made criminals \nby necessity whether they like it or not. \nTHEBLOOD \nBOND \nThere is more rampant hypocrisy throughout the Movement on this issue than \nperhaps on all others combined. No anarch wants to be enslaved to an elder; given \na choice, most would much rather die instead. The Bond is the one punishment that \nwill drive an otherwise rational anarch into the Sabbat. Many go, hoping and praying \nthey will be able to escape once the Bond is broken. Pitifully few ever return, and \nthose who do are never quite the same. Despite this, they go anyway, so strong is their \ndesire to be free. Without a doubt, anarchs see the Bond as one of the most heinous \ncrimes a vampire can commit - \nusually. \nThere are exceptions to every rule, and always people to make them when it suits \ntheir purposes. The default position of most anarchs is that the Bond is always wrong \nno matter who is Bound to whom for what reason, but more than a few find ar least \none reason to Bond someone for something. The most popular exception is a m.utua1 \nBond between lovers (many anarchs are still too young to have given up mortal habits \nlike boyfriends and girlfriends). Critics contend that condoning mutual Bonds is like \nCHAPTER \nTHREL: THE RLBEL UNLIFE \n91 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsaying it’s acceptable to be hooked on heroin if the heroin is also hooked on you, but \nthat argument isn’t very persuasive after the fact. \nBeyond mutual Bonds, some anarchs believe it’s acceptable to Bond anyone \noutside the Movement, or outside their own faction, or even outside their own gang. \nWhen called on it, they generally respond with a half-hearted justification that boils \ndown to “it’s unfortunate but necessary given the circumstances.’’ This argument \nseldom convinces anyone, but they make it anyway. Most mercenaries and nihilists \nwill go to great lengths to avoid being Bound themselves, but Bond others without \nhesitation or remorse. This is one of the main reasons for their lack of popularity \namong the other factions. \nStill, despite all the exceptions and the hypocrisy, the Blood Bond remains the \nmost hated and reviled of practices. So reviled, in fact, that anarchs long ago \ndeveloped a different name for it: Blood Slavery. A regnant is a Blood Slaver; a thrall \nis a Blood Slave. The latter is a victim to be liberated while the former is a criminal \nto be punished. In most anarch communities, Blood Slavery is a capital offense. \nGHOULY \nIf anarchs could reach universal consensus on at least one issue, the question of \nghouls should be it. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. Many of the same idealists \nwho decry “Blood Slavery” among vampires turn a blind eye toward the keeping of \nghouls, if only from sheer pragmatism - \nafter all, it’s hard to maintain ghouls without \nestablishing a bond, and they have to have s m e  way of keeping their many retainers \nloyal. Others denounce this as hypocrisy, asserting that even mortals who choose to \ngain the strengths of the Blood and enter avampire’s service still have rights. No matter \nhow well-treated they might be, they are still slaves - \nand slavery is wrong. \nFor all the passion of the debate, in truth it is often a mmt point in a vampire’s nightly \nexistence. It’seasytoupholdyourprinciplesinavacuum, buteventhemostdedicatedidealists \nare often forced to compromise when reality starts grinding them down. They might delay it \nas long as they can - \nsome gangs have been known to pass ghouls from one member to the \nnext for yean on end in an attempt to prevent the ghouls from being cumpktely bound - \nbut \neventually, circumstances force even the most reluctant of moralists to make an exception. \nAnd after the first, each additional exception becomes that much easier to rationalize. \nThat said, it bears noting that mainstream anarchs seldom think any less of \nghouls than they think of each other or, for that matter, normal mortals who are \nwilling participants in the revolution. Many anarchs have a standing pledge to \nEmbrace their retainers if those retainers are mortally wounded while serving the \ncause, or to let them die naturally if that is what they prefer. What’s more, unlike the \npoor dumb bastards enslaved to a callous Camarilla elder, anarch ghouls can usually \nexpect their regnants to stick by them in a pinch. \nTHF FMRRACF \nFor many anarchs, their rebellion began the very night of their Embrace, and they \nview that event as the first and most outrageous of innumerable injustices visited upon \nthem ever since. No matter how well they come to terms with their new existence as \nvampires, they bear their sires little but hatred for the ultimate crime of sentencing \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n92 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthem to this eternal punishment. Even those who forgo revenge find it next to \nimpossible to forgive or forget. Accordingly, bestowing a cruel or even just c,mal \nEmbrace is the one line they will not cross, and most utterly despise those who {do. \nTo Embrace a mortal against that mortal’s will, anarchs argue, is to utterly reject \neverything the Movement stands for. In practice, some sires are far more discrimmat- \ning about what exactly constitutes consent than are others, but even a normally \ncallous nihilist will occasionally make a token effort to solicit agreement prior to \ndoing the deed. Of course, no mortal can truly make an infomed choice about \nwhether or not to become a vampire, but a less ignorant decision is better than \nnothing. As it is, it’s often far more than an anarch‘s sire offered her. \nThis is not to say that all anarchs are victims of a cruel twist of fate -far \nfrom it. \nAlthough relatively rare in comparison to the number of anarchs who have defected \nto the Movement from oppressive unlives, some revolutionaries went willingly into \nundeath or even straight into the ranks of the anarchs. Groomed by sires interested in \ncontinuing the struggle or naturally excited at the chance to eternally advance their \nown social agendas, such “ready-made” anarchs tend to be much more prepared to deal \nwith the realities of vampiric unlife and the hardships encountered while fighting for \nthe Movement. If they have a common fault, it is that they may sometimes be a touch \ntoo idealistic when dealing with other anarchs who have endured harder unlives; \nhowever, this varies widely depending on the anarch in question. \nThis is not to say that all anarchs are so scrupulous when choosing to Embrace, \nespecially when their fellows aren’t around to condemn them. Plenty of mercenaries \nin the world will put the bite on anyone they think might be useful to them in their \nbusiness, and many nihilists will Embrace on a whim if they’re bored. According to \nrumor, at least one infamous nihilist wanders the United States siring and immedi,itely \nabandoning as many as ten childer in a single night just to cause trouble for the local \nprince. While other nihilists think this is absolutely hysterical, there are literally \nhundreds of more socially responsible anarchs who would love to see this thug dead. \nDIARLFRIF \nAccording to the elders of the Camarilla, diablerie is the most heinous and \ndespicable crime one vampire can commit against another. They should know, \nconsidering that many among them have committed this act at least once. More than \na few have several times consumed the souls of their own elders; indeed, had thev not \ndone so, they likely wouldn’t have survived the centuries. The elders of today were \nthe neonates of the Great Revolt, and they well remember the sweet taste of power \non their lips. True, legend has it that Caine himself forbade diablerie, but that’:; not \nwhy the elders forbid the practice. They know where it got them, and they have no \nintention of allowing their own childer to take the same road to power. \nTo a certain extent, their propaganda works. Most neonates believe diablerie is \nindeed the foulest of deeds. Most neonates are not anarchs, however, and anarchs \nbelieve otherwise. For millennia, elders have used to potency of their blood to crush \nthe lesser generations beneath their heels like serpents. Anarchs believe those \nserpents, once stepped on, should turn and bite the heels of their oppressors. And if \nCHAPITRTHREE: \nTHE REBEL UNLIFE \n93 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe means exist to turn the awesome power of the elders against them, those serpents \nwould be fools to leave that weapon unused. \nFew m h s  take a cavalier attitude toward diablerie, however. If nodung else, fear of \ndiscovery anddeath prevents most fromever going quite that far. Thedlfferencebetweenanarchs \nand less radical neonates is that for anarchs, diablerie isn’t necessarily anathema. Cmsuming the \nsoul of another merely for the thrill of the experience and the increase in blood potency is \ninexcusable, but talung power from thw who abuse it and wielding it against them in defense \nof liberty is an act of courage and nobility. Among anarchs, motive matters. ofall who stalk the \nnight beneath the moon and stars, fear mast the fanatic who believes himself justifid. \nIn this \nrespect, anarchs have far more in common with the Sabbat than m\ny\n \nare willing to admit. \nGOLCONDA \nFor the vast majority of anarchs, Golconda is nothing more than a fairy tale told \nby elders who still pine for their lost humanity after all their many centuries in \ndarkness. There is no substance to the myth, and only the colossally gullible ever fall \nfor this wishful fantasy. The Embrace is a one-way trip. Once a vampire, always a \nvampire. There is no going back. \nAt least, that’s the conventional wisdom. The truth of the matter is that more \nthan a few anarchs suspect there might actually be something to the myth after all, \nthey’re just not sure what that something is. The more philosophical among their \nranks suggest that Golconda represents the ultimate in liberation. For the undead, \nwhat could possibly be more liberating than conquering the so-called Curse of Caine \nand becoming mortal again? \nNevertheless, few in the Movement are in any position to forsake concerns temporal \nfor concerns spiritual. It’s hard to achieve enlightenment when you’re busy trying to \nachieve your next meal without the scourge dragging you in for poaching. Those who \nwander the night with their heads in the clouds usually come down to find their asses in \nbig trouble. According to rumor, many autarchs withdrew from vampire society to seek \nthis “ultimate liberation” (and that’s one reason why so many anarchs secretly respect \nthem), but if any have found it, they have yet to bring it back to the masses. \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n94 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THL REBEL UNLIR \n95 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nANARCH \nFRFF \nTFRRITORIFS \nAnarch communities come in many sizes, from the tiniest of slums supporting \na single coterie on the fringe of Camarilla- or Sabbat-held cities to entire metropoli- \ntan areas completely under anarch control. What follows is a brief study of their \norganization, leadership styles and some of the challenges facing their residents on \na night-to-night basis. \nORGANIZATION \nFNFMY \nTFRRITORY \nWhen the Camarilla, the Sabbat or another powerful entity dominates a metropo- \nlis, anarchs are usually few and far between. Organization is very loose or essentially \nnonexistent - \nother than hanging out together in their meager hunting grounds, they \ncan’t do very much without provoking their own destruction. Few anarchs wave the flag \nwith any vigor when overwhelmingly outnumbered, seeing no point in throwing their \nlives away when there’s little hope of lasting gain for the survivors. \nIn survival situations, continuing the struggle is all that matters. Anarchs who \nwillingly remain in such areas when they have the means to move elsewhere are \neither unmotivated posers or disciplined guerrillas. The posers tend to drop out of \nsociety altogether or go over to the other side when they get tired of existing on the \nragged edge. Guerrillas usually belong to covert terrorist and insurrection cells, \nsmuggling arms, allies and information under the enemy’s nose. Such revolutionaries \nare dedicated and highly dangerous to those in power. They do not hesitate to \neliminate anyone who threatens their operational security - \nincluding setting up \nother foolhardy or careless anarchs whose behavior threatens to expose their efforts \nto those in power. \nAnarchs in these territories tend to recognize no greater leader beyond those \nthey appoint to head up their own gangs or cells, and may not even stay in contact \nwith other local anarchs for fear of what might happen if one of their members is \ncaptured and tortured or mind-raped by the enemy. Much to the chagrin of Camarilla \nelders, rumors of a charismatic revolutionary leader in such territories are often \nnothing more than anarch propaganda designed to draw attention away from their \nmembers and cause foes to waste time chasing after a mythical enemy. \nDISPUTED \nTFRRITORIFS \nWhenneither the Camarilla nor the Sabbat completely dominates a metropolis, \nit logically follows that anarchs are both more numerous and more visibly active. \nWith greater numbers comes greater potential for change, and more often than not, \nlocal anarchs begin to defer to the most charismatic leader to make decisions for the \ngroup. Such leaders usually have a few trusted lieutenants whose loyalty is beyond \nquestion, and act as intermediaries between the anarchs and any other group with \nwhich the revolutionaries need to speak. Area anarchs might not agree with their \nleader on every issue, but she’ll do until someone better comes along; if the situation \nbecomes truly unbearable, either the leader will be deposed or a representative \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n96 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncouncil will be established to divide power between the local gangs. Full-fledged \ncouncils remain rare in disputed territories, however - \nfor better or worse, it is \ngenerally more useful to have one clear leader in times of conflict who can make quick \ndecisions than a dozen individuals of equal and possibly conflicting authority. \nTrouble occurs when more than one natural leader arises in a given area. Given \na choice, most anarchs follow leaders who best express their own beliefs, consciously \nrecognized or otherwise. If these personalties can co-exist or even work together, the \nresults can be impressive indeed; if they battle over methods or ideals, however, a \nbitter and explosive rivalry is sure to ensue. Sadly, potential troublemakers eager to \nplay a part in these violent tragedies are relatively common in anarch communities, \nnot to mention manipulative sect elders lurking in the wings trying to provoke such \ndramas at every opportunity. The same determination that gives a neonate the \nstrength to defy her elders and resist assimilation often makes her equally unwilling \nto compromise her ideals among her peers. To do so is to surrender her individual self \nand the principles around which she has based her unlife, and that’s just too much \nfor her to bear. \nThat said, it’s also a fact that anarch enclaves within disputed territories are still \nso small and comparatively weak that factional conflict very rarely escalates beyond \nconstant trash-talking, shouting matches and occasional brawls between hot-headed \nindividuals. Outright violence is frowned on by all sides, and inflicting Final Death \non a rival is almost certain to result in the immediate death of the offender and \ncensure of his entire gang as well. Even if rival gangs control adjacent turf, members \nusually stay in their home territories and don’t go looking for trouble - \nat least not \ndirectly. For as passionate as they might be, all but the dimmest of nihilists also \nrecognize that there are not enough revolutionaries to throw their unlives away in \npetty disputes with each other, especially with larger powers like the sects waiting to \npounce on the survivors. \nANARCH \nTFRRITORIFg \nMost rare of all are those few metropolitan areas wherein the anarchs are the \ndominant political force. Such cities can be shining examples of the strength and \nrighteousness of the cause. They can just as easily be embarrassing reminders of all \nthat is selfish and evil in the Children of Caine. Most chart a difficult course between \nthe two extremes as their citizens struggle to answer the calling of their consciences \ndespite the demands of their Beasts. \nIn general, the smaller the community, the fewer problems it suffers. Organiza- \ntion depends entirely on the level of civic duty felt by the citizens of such \ncommunities. Most anarch gangs are content to let their appointed leaders manage \nthe community as a whole while they deal with the issues of night-to-night existence. \nSo long as these leaders remember to lead by advice and example rather than nile by \ndictation and destruction, they retain their authority to mediate whatever disputes \ncan’t be resolved without their intervention. Leaders who let their authority go to \ntheir heads quickly lose the respect on which that authority is based, and tend tO lose \ntheir positions shortly afterward. \nCHAPIERTHREE \nTHE RIBEL UNLIFE \n91 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAnarchs often believe that allowing a single vampire to be installed in a position of \nlasting, consolidated, “official” authority is an invitation to tyranny. While asingle baron \nmay represent a smaller community or be chosen to act as the proverbial “first among \nequals” for a representative body, given a chance anarchs generally prefer to govern their \nlarger communities via some form of council. Many of these councils begin as mere udhoc \nadvisory panels formed by the most civic-minded members of the community, but as the \ncommunity grows larger councilors find they require increasingly formal management in \norder to maintain harmony among the resident gangs and ensure that all anarchs feel their \nconcerns are being addressed properly. While the actual form a city’s council takes can \nbe whatever the community desires- -from a republic with councilors chosen by popular \nvote to a council of the most experienced anarchs in the city to something as arbitrary \nas representatives chosen by lottery- as a rule all councils have some means of including \nat least one member from each distinct gang or faction within the community (not each \nclan). Doing otherwise invites unrest and ill will from any faction slighted. \nNaturally, some radicals insist that any concentrationofpower is utterly unaccept- \nable. To these anarchists, power is rightfully vested only in the community as a whole. \nThey tolerate almost no formal government structure -when \na problem arises, they \nconvene popular assemblies wherein all interested citizens collectively decide how that \nproblem should be solved and act on it. While other anarchs respect their comrades’ \ndecisions in this respect, unfortunately the sects often find this structure relatively easy \nto exploit when attempting to conquer the territory; while it is harder to cripple the \nlocal anarchs by targeting specific individuals, it is also hard for the area’s revolution- \naries to coordinate strategy or reach any rapid decisions regarding imminent threats. \nRegardless of their particular structure, however, all Anarch Free Territories are \nremarkable for the level of liberty and privacy their citizens enjoy. So long as the \nresidents keep the Masquerade and avoid interfering in each other’s personal affairs, \nthey are generally free to come and go as they please, associate with whom they will, \nhunt as need dictates and sire as often as suits them. Not all of them last, for one \nreason or another, but the fact that they are possible makes the struggle worthwhile \nto anarchs everywhere. This is precisely why elders hate and fear Anarch Free \nTerritories and seek to subvert them at every opportunity. \nL F A I X R ~ H I ~  \nThough most are loath to admit it even to themselves, anarch territories \nfrequently have “officers” who fulfill necessary roles in their communities. The \ndifferences between them lie primarily in the source and extent of their authority. In \ntheory, a Camarilla prince is an absolute authority unto himself within his domain; \nsimilarly, a Sabbat archbishop answers only to a cardinal and controls the local packs \nthrough orders passed down through subordinates. Anarch leaders, on the other \nhand, derive their authority solely from the consent of the communities in which \nthey reside. As a result, their power is often very broad but not especially forceful, \nbeyond whatever means they have of enforcing it themselves. Simply put: So long \nas the community respects her judgment, it will follow her lead. Should a leader lose \nher popularity, even someone as “lofty” as a baron, the community will ignore her. \nTHE ANARCH GIIDL \n98 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBARON \nCommunities led by a single anarch or councils that choose a member to represent \ntheir collective interests generally call that vampire a baron. In essence, the baron IS first \namong equals in the community. His fellow anarchs defer to him because they believe he \nis the best and brightest among them and therefore the least likely to lead them all to ruin. \nHe is responsible for keeping the peace between various anarch factions, which means \nin practice he spends most of his time handling dispute resolution. \nWhenever two anarchs (or two gangs) have a problem and they just can’t seem \nto work it out peacefully, it’s the baron who settles it for them the best way he can. \nThe problem in many communities is that by the time the baron steps in, it might \nalready be too late for a peaceful solution. When two or more gangs go to war with \neach other, the baron can often do little but throw up his hands and wait for the words \nor worse yet the bullets to stop flying. \nA baron’s power depends on his personal magnetism to a greater extent than any other \nanarch position. Given the wariness with which most anarchs regard a solitary figure in a \nposition of authority, a baron must tread carefully in order to ensure that his word carries \nreal weight with the local gangs, without appearing to go too far and be setting himself up \nas littlebetterthanapettytyrant. Hemighthavegottenthe job because t h e p p l e  thought \nhe was the smartest or the strongest, but he’ll keep the job only if they like what he d w  with \nit. Sooner or later, he’ll have to make a decision that others are going to disagree with. If he \nis blessed with sufficient standing and charisma, he can make an unpopular decision ,stick. \nIf not, he’ll be ignored and the locals will find a new baron to follow. \nCOUNCILOR \nCommunities led by some form of council, whether it has a formal name or not, \ngenerally call those individuals councilors. In function, a councilor has many of the \nsame duties as a baron, especially regarding the pack or faction she represents; the \nonly difference is that she shares her authority with her fellow councilors. Councils \nare common in larger communities where the locals can’t agree on a single person to \nserve as baron, or where the locals don’t trust one person with total authority and seek \nan additional failsafe measure to prevent abuse. \nCouncils have slightly less trouble convincing their communities to accept and \nabide by unpopular decisions because they are viewed as less arbitrary and potentially \ntyrannical than a single baron. However, councils occasionally have trouble reach- \ning a decision in the first place. They often deadlock over controversial issues, and \nbickering between councilors occasionally results in one or more of them resigning \nfrom the council in disgust. Unless a community has the foresight to establish some \nbasic rules for fairly settling such disputes without intervention by a baron or other \noutside figure, a council can easily collapse under its own weight the first time one \ncouncilor tries to implement a plan or idea that another finds abhorrent. \nIt bears noting that councils almost never determine representative seating by clan \n-that, according to most anarchs, is reactionary baggage reminiscent of the Camarilla’s \nprimogen councils. Instead, they tend to seat councilors by peer group. Each gang in \nthe city might have arepresentative, for instance, as would any other distinct social set. \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE REBEL UNLIR \n99 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nOTHER \nOFFICERS \nBarons and councilors alike rely on assistants to manage community affairs. \nNone of these assistants have formal titles, merely nicknames that refer to the nature \nof the jobs they perform. Like the barons and councilors they work for, they have only \nas much authority as they can personally command, and they certainly gain no social \nstatus from their positions. Among anarchs, respect gets you the job, not the other \nway around. \nThose who represent the community to other sects and independent clans are \ncalled ambassadors, diplomats or emissaries. The primary responsibility of an ambas- \nsador is to meet with princes, primogen or even bishops and convince these elders \nthat it is in their best interests to help (or at least ignore) the anarchs she represents. \nSmall wonder, then, that ambassadors are also often called by a far more cynical \nname: expendable. \nThose who track the comings and goings of vampires into and out of the city are \ncalled counters, monitors or sweepers. Barons and councilors need to keep track of \nwho is in the community and what they’re doing there, but demanding that fellow \nanarchs present themselves upon entering the area would get them laughed out of \noffice in less time than it takes to tell about it. Counters thus keep an eye on the city \nand let the leaders know when there’s a new face in town. \nTHE ANARCH \n100 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n+? \ni \ne \nAlthough few anarch communities have the numbers to support such groups, \nthose that can often recruit volunteers who can be counted on to defend the city, \nintervene in inter-gang warfare and otherwise apply force at the behest of the \ncouncil. Such vampires are called deputies, sentinels or simply the militia. In order \nto combat allegations of corruption as well as the natural distrust that many anarchs \nhave for anyone with “official” authority to use force, most councils take care to ask \nfor deputies from each gang in order to ensure that everyone feels they are being \ntreated fairly. \nThose who infiltrate the enemy to gather intelligence are called Bonds or moles. \nNo matter how peaceful the community, it must always fear an attack from Camarilla \nor Sabbat forces intending to crush it and claim the city for themselves. The primary \nresponsibility of a mole is to leam of such attacks and get warning to the threatened \ncommunity so it can muster a defense. Moles pass less urgent info from time to time \nas well, such as when a particularly hated elder might be vulnerable or the schedule \nfor the scourge’s next anti-anarch sweep. \nTHF ~ F O ~ L F ’ S A R M Y  \nANARCH \nGANGS \nMore often than not, anarchs are creatures of the city streets, whether they came \nfrom them as mortals or became familiar with them after the Embrace. Accordingly, \nthe most common social unit among anarchs is the gang, which follows many parallels \nto modem urban gangs (though not quite as many as Camarilla elders claim). \nGangs serve two very important purposes. The most obvious is acting as a \ndeterrent against enemies threatening their members. Alone, the average anarch is \nrelatively easy prey, since he is young and often thin-blooded compared to his \ntraditional foes. However, potential assailants often think twice about attacking him \nif that means fighting a protracted and costly war with his entire gang. Eliminating \na single anarch is almost never worth the sudden firestorm of retaliatory violence that \ninvariably erupts. Accordingly, wearing gang colors or otherwise dressing to rleveal \nher association acts as a warning sign to everyone that no matter where an anarch \ngoes, she is never without allies. \nBeyond mere physical security lies a more important purpose. Simply put, \nexistence as a vampire is lonely, and anarch unlife can be lonelier still. In gangs, \nmembers find desperately needed comfort and reassurance in a very cold and tlrutal \nworld. Refugees find themselves drawn together by circumstance and united by a \nsense of common misery, and band together in groups with unspoken promises \nprovide each other with the friendship and support denied them by society. Gang \nmembers live together, fight together and often die together. Others might look \ndown on their lifestyle as shallow or dysfunctional, but members themselves can \nreach levels of genuine devotion unknown to most vampires. \nCHAPTERTHREE: \nTHE RIBEL UNLFE \n101 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSTRUCTURE \nGangs differ primarily in structure, size and mobility. The structure of a gang \ndepends on its purpose. Almost by definition, gangs are quasi-military organizations, \nand collectively they are the closest thing to a standing army the Anarch Movement \nhas. In practice, however, they function as permanent independent militias. While \nthey readily cooperate to repel the occasional Sabbat crusade or, more rarely, an \narchon-led Camarilla task force, they spend most of their time fighting each other \nover ideological differences. Gangs that consider it evil to keep human servants no \nmatter what, for example, bitterly oppose gangs that rely on ghouls for extra muscle, \nand open conflict of one kind or another between such natural enemies is the norm. \nGang leaders have more authority over their followers and can, within reason, \nissue orders to their people with a reasonable expectation ofbeing obeyed. Surprisingly, \ndiscipline within the ranks is seldom a genuine problem, since any member who truly \nloses faith in her leaders may simply challenge them for command or call for a vote of \nconfidence. Together, these customs keep gang leaders relatively fair and honest. \nURBAN \nGANGS \nThe smallest gangs are little more than a single group of five to seven members, \nwith perhaps one or two members acting as the leader. Small gangs rarely control \nmore than a single neighborhood unless their members are unusually powerful \nindividually, or they maintain a veritable army of ghouls to bolster their battlefield \nstrength. Since a number of anarchs eschew using ghouls for ideological reasons, and \nmaintaining so many ghouls at the same time is such a tremendous strain, few gangs \nresort to this tactic unless in dire straits indeed. As aresult, small gangs either “squat” \non a larger gang’s turf (often paying tribute to do so) or ally with other gangs of similar \nsize to even the balance of power in an area. \nLarger gangs have seven to fifteen members usually subdivided into two or three \ngroups, called “sets.” Each set has a leader who functions as a lieutenant to the gang’s \noverall leader. These larger sets have the strength to control two or three neighbor- \nhoods in an area. Each set comprising the gang has a home neighborhood under its \ncontrol; the gang leader most often maintains his headquarters in the largest. Gangs of \nthis size form in one of two ways: Either a small gang gains a number of recruits in a \nrelatively short period of time, or a number of small gangs decide to merge into a single \nfamily, with each gang then becoming a set of the new gang. The latter event usually \noccurs when the component gangs of an alliance espouse the same or very similar \nbeliefs, but only one has a truly charismatic leader. Over time, that leader inadvertently \nattracts loyal followers of her own, further strengthening the gang as a whole. \nThe largest gangs have more than fifteen members subdivided into several sets. \nEach set controls a single home neighborhood. Each neighborhood is usually \nadjacent to another controlled by the same gang, or is of such strategic significance \nthat it is considered worthwhile to hold despite its relatively vulnerable position. \nCollectively, these neighborhoods comprise a single territorial claim that often \noccupies an entire city ward. The gang leader generally maintains a main headquar- \nters in the central or most easily defended area of this turf; his set leaders usually \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \nio2 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmaintain smaller “offices” in the neighborhoods they control. In exceedingly rare \ncases, a single gang can grow large enough to dominate an entire city and even claim \nturf in other cities nearby. In this case, the gang leader becomes a “general” with a \n“captain” who controls the turf in each city via his lieutenants in each set. The \ngeneral maintains a headquarters in the city his gang dominates with smaller \nheadquarters for eachcaptain in the satellite cities, and at least one set that routinely \ntravels between cities as a “courier” group. \nNOMADIC \nGANGS \nOne variation on the normal theme is the nomadic gang, similar in structure to \na“sett1ed” gang but different because it either lacks the strength to claim turf or, more \noften, simply prefers unlife on the open road. Nomadic gangs frequently pattern \nthemselves on mortal biker clubs rather than urban gangs, though for obvious reasons \nall but the most daring or reckless of such gangs always travel with trucks, vans and \nRVs in their caravans. Some have well-deserved reputations for raising hell, a fact \nthat often earns them a chilly reception from fellow anarchs who live under the \nwatchful eye of astern prince. Others keep alower profile, content to avoid notoriety \nwhile quietly spreading the word of revolution among vampires everywhere. Either \nway, they keep arms and information moving between cities. Without them, the \nMovement would be severely disadvantaged. \nIn practice, nomadic gangs recruit members, operate and divide authority in \nmuch the same way as other gangs, but with two pronounced changes: first, they tend \nto break into much smaller sets than settled gangs, if only to avoid the unwanted \nattention that a caravan of thirty or forty bikers or a dozen cars attracts even among \nthe local mortal population. Second, individual sets tend to have a corresponclingly \nlarger amount of freedom to do as they please given the amount of time they spend \napart from the whole. Most nomadic gangs hold periodic gathers where members \nshare stories, trade supplies and information or just enjoy each other’s company. \nGUERRILLA \nUNITSAND \nTERRORIST \nCELLS \nAnother variation on the normal theme is the guerrilla unit, identical in \nstructure to mortal “1iberationfronts”and “revolutionary armies” ifnot quite so large. \nUnlike nomadic or settled gangs, guerrilla units exist completely underground. An \naverage guerrilla unit operates alone or in small, independent cells. As a precaution, \neach member knows only her immediate superior in the chain of command and the \nother members of her cell. All communication between cells is done by coded \nmessages, Discipline use or similar arcane methods that are difficult to trace, let alone \ncrack or corrupt with bad information. In cities where multiple cells are active, each \nmust trust the unit’s central leadership for that city to keep them from unknowingly \ninterfering with each other’s activities. This pattern of secrecy repeats at each level \nof leadership. Even then, the central leadership almost always replaces the compro- \nmised cells before the enemy can act decisively on the information it has gained. \nGuerrilla units do not claim turf. When they can, they manage secret training \nfacilities far from the prying eyes of archons and templars, but are ready to abandon \nthese camps as quickly and efficiently as they can whenever they are discovered. \nCHAPTER \nTHEE: THE RIBEL UNLIR \n103 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThey stand and fight only when no other option is available or when the odds are so \nheavily in their favor that victory is certain. Often, the first and only sign of their \npresence is a sudden overwhelming assault on the prince or archbishop and his \npersonal retinue of bodyguards. By the time the smoke clears and long before any \nreaction force can arrive, the guerrillas have incapacitated the bodyguards, killed or \ncaptured their target and disappeared into the night. This is the essence of uncon- \nventional warfare: to strike without warning, devastate the enemy in a single blow \nand then vanish, leaving him nothing tangible to target for retaliation. \nSecrecy is paramount among guerrilla units. Many reveal their existence only \nthrough pamphlets that define their agendas and justify their activities (often \ndropped at the scene of an action), and they guard the locations of their strongholds \nand the identities of their members with fanatical zeal. Despite the modern trappings \nof this form of revolution, their ranks can include the oldest and most powerful \nvampires in the Movement. Regardless of age, even newly recruited guerrillas quickly \nbecome wanted for a number of offenses that would result in their immediate \nexecution if they are ever captured and properly identified. Good cell leaders use this \nto their advantage, forging additional bonds of loyalty through shared criminal \nactivities or discouraging defection by ensuring that no one member would likely \nsurvive the justice of the enemy, even if he turned traitor willingly. Some guerrillas \nremain on the move, communicating through trusted intermediaries and avoiding \ncontact with anyone not known to them personally. Others hide in plain sight - \nhaving either permanently altered their appearances or eliminated any enemy who \ncan recognize them, they assume cover identities in the Camarilla or (rarely) the \nSabbat, biding their time until they can go active once again. \nGFTTING \nIN \nThe process of joining a gang is fairly standard regardless of the type of gang a \nparticularanarchjoins. It is asimpleprocess, buthardly aneasy one. It almostgoeswithout \nsaying that a vampire can’t just walk up to a gang member and ask to join his gang - \nthat \napproach gets her nowhere. At best, the member laughs in her face and then ignores her. \nAt worst, he strings her along with promises of membership and then hangs her out to dry \nafter getting her into serious trouble, possibly even leaving her to take the fall for one of \nthe gang’s actions. If an anarch really wants to join agang, he must first demonstrate that \nhe is committed to the Anarch Movement in general and the gang’s agenda in particular. \nOnce he does this, the gang he wants to join generally comes to him with aseries of formal \nor informal tests that must be completed before the gang considers granting even partial \nmembership. It may take months, years or even decades depending on the size and secrecy \nlevel of the gang, but if he’s truly down, the wait doesn’t bother him. Remember that \nvampires think in the long term, especially older ones -while a common street gang may \nnot be able to afford to wait adecade to get anew member when there’s a war on the streets \nright now, an elite guerrilla cell might find that wait perfectly reasonable. \nWhile individual trials vary widely from gang to gang, there are some constants. \nUrban gangs tend to require new members to commit a series of crimes, or possibly \ngive a prospective recruit a goal (such as raise a certain amount of money) and judge \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n104 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhis efforts against their own sense of style. Nomadic packs might require him to \nsimply keep up with them over the course of agrueling itinerary while driving a stolen \nvehicle (without getting caught), or otherwise assess his resilience and resourceful- \nness. A guerrilla unit might test a prospective member’s knowledge of their ideology \nas well as the practical skills he can offer them, and possibly require him to commit \na daring act of insurrection in their name and escape clean. In addition to these more \nspecific tests, in nearly every case a prospective gang member must endure repeated \nattempts to discourage him, whether through verbal harassment and intimidation, \nrepeated public humiliation or in some cases outright physical violence. Naturally, \nwhether he is supposed to hold his own in such situations or simply take the \npunishment stoically depends on the gang and the member in question. \nPRO~PECT \nEventually, if he passes the tests and makes the right impression on the right people, \na gang member approaches him and asks a final round of often highly loaded questions \nto determine his sincerity. If he gives the right answers (not an easy task), he becomes a \n“prospect.” From that point forward, he must hang with the set that controls his \nneighborhood, make an honest effort to acquaint himself with every member of the gang \n- \nmany of whom will feign complete disinterest or even outright hostility -- and \nparticipate in various missions against the gang’s enemies. This is a probationary period \nduring which he is watched closely by the gang, particularly leaders of the set he tnight \nultimately join. During this time, his sponsor is a constant companion, singing his praises \nwhen he does well and defending him when he makes mistakes. The sponsor’s job is \ncritical; almost a second sire, she guides her prospect through his probationary period and \nconvinces the rest of the gang that he deserves to be initiated into the “family.” \nACCEPTANCE \nWhen every member of the gang accepts the prospect as an equal, he bewmes \na “cousin.” As a cousin, he must keep faith with his family, uphold gang ideals and \nobey his set leader (and his set leader often assigns apparently pointless tasks just to \ntest his patience and loyalty). If he possesses a great degree of proficiency in any \nDisciplines not common within his set, he must teach those Disciplines to the best \nof his capability. He may ask to learn other Disciplines in return, but no one is \nobligated to teach him. He may participate in open debate of gang issues, but he may \nnot vote, and he may not challenge for leadership. During this time, his sponsor \nprovides basic instruction about the gang’s structure, history, customs, ideology, \nmethodology and territory. If necessary, she provides similar instruction about the \nAnarch Movement in general. This training, called “indoctrination,” is necessary to \nimpart the proper attitude about the gang, their operations, their enemies and unlife \nin general. The new cousin must complete this indoctrination to his sponsor’s \nsatisfaction before his final initiation. \nINITIATION \nWhen the sponsor is satisfied, she informs the set leader that the new member \nis ready to be initiated. The set leader informs the gang leader and the two of them \narrange the initiation ordeal. This ordeal generally requires the new member to pass \nCAAPTER \nTHREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n105 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nseveral torturous physical and psychological tests designed to reveal hidden weak- \nnesses that would be a liability to the rest of the gang. Some of the tests are quite \nsevere; failure might even mean Final Death. If any test reveals a disqualifying \nweakness (and the recruit survives his failure), he is denied full membership until he \novercomes the weakness. At least three times during the ordeal, he is offered the \nchance to back out without dishonor. The offer is not generally a trick; if he backs \nout, he is allowed to leave with no negative repercussions other than a vow of silence \nor a selective mindwipe to remove any knowledge of the tests he has passed so far. \nBefore the last offer, the gang leader explains the benefits and responsibilities of full \nmembership as well as the punishments for cowardice and betrayal. If he maintains \nhis intent to join, the gang leader administers a loyalty oath. After taking the oath, \nhe accepts his colors from his justifiably proud sponsor. \nBecause of their independent-cell structure, guerrilla units maintain far more \nsecrecy regarding their members. A prospect never meets the other members of his \ncell until he takes the loyalty oath. Prior to this moment, their identities remain \nhidden. His sponsor leads him through the entrance tests. The cell leader administers \nthe loyalty oath in the name of the central committee. Guerrilla units never gather \nen masse to initiate new members. As a consequence, cell leaders bear a far greater \nresponsibility to choose new recruits carefully and are correspondingly far more \ndifficult to impress in the first place. In practice, prospects for membership in guerrilla \nunits endure years or even decades on probation before earning the full trust of their \ncell leaders. Many lose patience and give up, but this only proves they lacked the \ndedication and discipline necessary to succeed at this level of the political game. \nFULL \nMFMRFRSHIP \nInitiation marks the point of no return. From that moment on, the new gang \nmember belongs to a sacred circle. His new family teaches him any Discipline he \ndesires and for which a teacher is available. He may participate in open debate of gang \nissues, vote and challenge for leadership. He may sponsor prospects for initiation and \nis oathbound to kill or die for his family, and his family is likewise oathbound to kill \nor die for him. Lastly, he may learn and practice the rituals of his sacred circle and \nis privy to any secret information solis sacredotibus (“only for the initiated”). Initiates \nof the same gang refer to each other (and only to each other) as “brother” or “sister” \naccording to gender. They seldom react well when called “brother” or “sister” by \nsomeone outside their gang and usually express their disagreement on the spot. \nGETTING \n0 UT \nSometimes, members break under extreme stress. A gang that suffers a humili- \nating defeat in a critical battle because one or more members froze in combat usually \nbrands the offenders as cowards and kicks them out. It is possible to atone for such \na disgrace, but few bother to try. If the cowards know too much to be allowed to live, \nor the gang lost important leaders to the enemy, the weak links might be summarily \nexecuted instead (larger gangs can afford the loss of manpower, while more militant \ngangs have less tolerance for failure). Willful betrayal always earns a brutal death for \nthe traitor. No matter where he goes, the gang he betrayed follows, spreading word \nt\ni\nTHE ANARCH G~IDE \n106 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof his treachery to all who listen. As the news spreads, other anarchs join the hunt. \nSooner or later, the fugitive drops his guard at the wrong time around the wrong \npeople - \nand wakes up to find himself in the custody of those he betrayed. Agony \ninvariably fills his last moments. \nAt the other end of the spectrum are members who simply lose their passton for \nthe gang unlifestyle -for whatever reason, they seek to leave the gang on their own \nterms. While any number of personal conflicts may result from such a momentous \ndecision, as a rule most gangs let such members go in peace provided they do not \nreveal gang secrets to outsiders and do not join a rival group or (worse still) one of \nthe sects. Some even maintain informal contact with former members for years or \neven decades afterward; after all, unlike the artificial feelings inspired by the Bond \nor the Vinculum, the emotional ties forged among members of anarch gangs do not \nautomatically fade with time. \nANCIFNTPROPHFCY, \nMOJXRNRFCRUITS \nTHE LAST GFNERATIONS \nAs the evidence mounts that Gehenna is no mere myth, but an actual and fast- \napproaching event, the Ivory Tower advocates and enforces a policy of denial. But \neven the most cynical of Kindred cannot help but recall whispers of the ancient \nprophecies that point to their own thin-blooded and clanless progeny as their \nundoing. Certain passages in the legendary Book of Nod seem to indicate that the \nclanless and thin-blooded are the harbingers of Gehenna, and will bring about the \ndestruction of all vampires throughout the world. \nThe thin-blooded themselves are all but oblivious of their role in Kindred myth. \nThey do not know that their appearance is the harbinger of Gehenna. They know only \nthat their weak blood, high generation, and obscure origins earn them the contempt \nand hatred of Kindred the world over. There is no haven or shelter for these outcasts, \nand they do not understand the bizarre and terrifying visions that constantly plague \nsome of their number even in waking moments. Perhaps those who bear this so-called \ngift might puzzle out the meaning of their insights and act on them to save both Kindred \nand kine from what is to come, but only if they can manage to survive that long. The \nAnarch Movement provides a refuge for the few thin-blooded who manage to endure \nlong enough to make some kind of sense out of their desperate existence. \nIt’s easy to understand why many of the Last Generations would throw in their \nlot with the dissidents of Kindred society. The sects view the thin-bloods as little \nmore than unwanted baggage fit only for abuse, or possibly as tools or dangerous \nweapons that must be either controlled or destroyed. Only the Movement can offer \nthese unfortunates anything resembling a fair shake, and even that’s not guaranteed. \nMore than a few anarchs are suspicious of thin-blooded Cainites: they’re (often \nrelegated to the dubious status of “probationary anarch until they’ve proven \nCHAPTER THREE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n107 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthemselves. Some anarchs are even downright abusive, seeking to exploit the thin- \nblooded however they can, much as members of the other sects do. Most anarchs are \nat least marginally welcoming, however, ready to accept (and make good use of) \nanyone who is willing to act and fight on behalf of the cause. They argue that the very \nfact that many elders and conservative Kindred are so up in arms about the thin- \nbloods makes them, if nothing else, allies of convenience. \nPortraying a thin-blooded character is a wonderful roleplaying opportunity. You \nare a walking contradiction. A comparative weakling among giants and a novice \namong vipers, your survival is a chancy thing at best; at the same time, your very \ninnocence of the Kindred and their society gives you a chance to see the night \nthrough a unique pair of eyes. Your mortal life isn’t yet totally behind you: perhaps \nit’s still within your grasp. Yet your new existence is a confusing puzzle that demands \na solution, and that can be gained only from the immortal Kindred. The result is a \ncharacter who walks the razor’s edge each night, and offers you a rich roleplaying \nexperience to put a fresh spin on the way you approach the game. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDL \n108 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSTEP \nONE: INSPIRATION \nStarting with her mortal life, decide who your character is. Who was she hefore \nthe Embrace? What did she do, think and feel? Where and how did she live?Hovr long \ndid her sire stick around, and what - \nif anything - \ndid she explain before she left? \nKeep in mind that, unlike most vampires, the thin-blooded generally aren’t culled \nfrom the ranks of the exceptional, unusual, or interesting. They’re more like average \npeople in their breathing days: lovers Embraced in the heat of passion, a vessel spared \nan accidentaldeath by aguilty conscience, friends and relativesEmbracedon awhim, \nor maybe an enemy granted undeath to make him suffer for all eternity. And all too \noften, these unfortunates don’t even know who to thank or blame for their dubious \ngift of unlife. \nClan \nRoughly half of all fourteenth-generation Kindred are Caitiff, and the remainder \nbelong to their sires’ clans. All fifteenth-generation characters are Caitiff, without \nexception: at this point, the Curse of Caine is so diluted that vitae no longer sustains \nthe special characteristics that help define a clan. \nMorality \nVirtually all thin-blooded vampires follow the Path of Humanity. They simply \nhaven’t had the time or opportunity to encounter alternate systems of morality among \nthe unliving. Should any of them survive the nights ahead, some will probably seek a \ndifferent ethos, but for the time being no alternative Path followers are known to exist. \nSTEP \nTwo: ATTRIBUTES \nCharacters of the fourteeenth and fifteenth generations assign only six Traits in \ntheir primary Attribute category. They still assign five Traits to their secondary \ncategory and three to their tertiary category, like all other vampire characters. \nGeneration \nDecide whether your character is fourteenth or fifteenth generation. Either \nrequires you to take the appropriate Flaw, which determines several of your inherent \nlimitations. Regardless of which you choose, don’t spend any Background Traits for \nyour Generation. \nTrait Maximums \nUnless otherwise noted, vampires of the Last Generations (fourteenth and \nfifteenth) have the same starting Traits and Trait maximums as thirteenth genera- \ntion vampires. \n’STEP THREE: \nADVANTAGF~ \nThis step is identical to creating a normal vampire character, except as noted below. \nDisciplines \nThin-blooded vampires begin play with only two Basic Discipline powers, and \ncan never raise any Discipline higher than the Intermediate level - \nfourteenth \ngeneration vampires may learn both Intermediate powers of a given Discipline, while \nfifteenth generation vampires may only learn the first Intermediate power of a \nDiscipline. Fourteenth generation vampires who belong to a clan may choose their \nCHAPTER \nTHEE: THE REBEL UNLIFE \n109 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nstarting Discipline powers only from those available to their clan; clanless vampires \nmay have any starting Discipline powers that they can justify learning. \nBackgrounds \nThe Last Generations can acquire the same Background Traits as all other \nvampires, within reason: Those mortals who enter the ranks of the thin-blooded are \nseldom in the social strata that wields Influence at city hall or hobnobs with celebrities, \nthough nothing actually forbids them from having such Traits. They can also take \nInsight, a new Background Trait that only the thin-blooded may possess (see below). \nSTFP \nFOUR: \nL A ~ T  \nTOUCHES \nThis step is identical to creating anormal vampire character, except as noted below. \nMerits and Flaws \nThin-blooded vampires have access to all the Merits and Flaws available to other \nvampires. Be aware, however, that some Merits and Flaws aren’t appropriate for the \nLast Generations: a fourteenth-generation Caitiff probably isn’t owed a Debt of \nGratitude and doesn’t have a Prestigious Sire. Note that three specific Flaws define the \nthin-blooded: Fourteenth Generation, Fifteenth Generation and Thin Blood (see Merits \nand Flaws of the Last Generations, below). \nOn the other hand, some Merits fit very well: Blush of H&, \nEat Food (fifteenth \ngeneration get this for free), Light Sleeper, Calm Heart and other so-called “mortal Merits” \nare often appropriate for the Last Generations, given their relative proximity to humanity. \nNEW \nBACKGROUNDS \nInsight \nAs if thin blood isn’t bad enough in its own right, a rare few among the Last \nGenerations have a knack for discerning the schemes and intrigues of the elders of \ntheir kind. Weird visions and uncomfortable hunches plague their waking hours, and \ntheir sleep is filled with strange, prophetic dreams. Insight is not a directed or \nintentional type of divination: it comes unbidden and unasked for. Insight manifests \nin unexpected and sometimes inconvenient ways. It’s not an all-purpose Magic 8- \nBall: it cannot be used to provide clear, specific answers to direct questions. The \nvisions and dreams that Insight generates are usually obscure, vague and often \nsymbolic. In fact, the more important the event or powerful the vampire involved in \nthe vision, the less clear the Insight experience will be. This can be unsettling for the \nseer and frustrating for those who wish to use the seer as a private oracle. \nSometimes your Storyteller will decide that you experience a spontaneous \nvision, hunch or dream as the result of your Insight. This could happen during a game \nsession, in which case you’ll have been handed a golden opportunity to do some truly \ndramatic and creepy roleplaying, or in the downtime between games. Your Story- \nteller may use your Insight to instigate plots and subplots: Some of these stories may \nput you in the spotlight, and for others you’ll be merely the catalyst. On these \noccasions, your Storyteller will determine the results of your Insight, at her discretion. \nShe may ask you to engage in a test to identify the exact details of your experience, \nor she may simply inform you of the nature of the vision. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n110 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that seers experience visions and dreams that \npertain only to the conflicts and schemes of vampires, and that although the Jyhad \nis avast struggle between ancient powers, vampires do not control everything. In fact, \nmost conflicts between vampires don’t have any wider significance, and not (every- \nthing that Insight reveals is necessarily connected to the Jyhad or Gehenna. \nAdditional Insight Rules \nTempting Fate: Intentional Insight \nYou may also attempt to provoke visions or hunches deliberately. Voluntary uses \nof Insight usually provide information that is less clear and detailed than that .which \nmanifests spontaneously, and the attempt could even fail entirely. To voluntarily use \nInsight, you must make a Static Mental Challenge against a number of Traits equal \nto the quality of detail you are trying to experience: four Traits for a vague sense of \nsignificance, seven for more direct hints about names or hidden plots, all the way up \nto ten Traits for truly dangerous details. Be careful what you wish for when in search \nof vital information, as your Storyteller may be only too happy to give it to you.. . . \nThe Occult Ability is used for retests. You can make as many separate attempts at \ndeliberate Insight as you want, but the subjects of each individual attempt must be \nunconnected. (The Storyteller determines whether or not two inquiries are unrelated.) \nFailing two deliberate Insight attempts in the same scene renders you exhausted and \nunable to call upon the powers of Insight for the remainder of the game session. \nGroup Insight \nIn the unlikely event that two or more seers meet, they can make a voluntary \nattempt to provoke Insight together in order to gain greater detail. First, each seer \nmust expend a Willpower Trait in order to participate in the attempt. Next, the seers \nengage in one simultaneous Static Mental Challenge against ten Traits. Each seer \nwho wins the test simultaneously shares the vision granted by the Insight; seers who \nlose the test cannot view what the others have seen, and suffer the loss of two Mental \nTraits for the remainder of the evening. If at least one participant wins the test, the \nprevailing seers experience a vision with a level of detail equivalent to a ten-Trait \nvoluntary Insight success. \nInsight Shock \nIt’s possible to see too much through group Insight. Such intense and horrific \nrevelations may overload the seers’ senses, temporarily shutting down their minds. \nWhen the group vision concludes, each seer who successfully engages in group \nInsight must make an immediate Mental Test against seven Traits. If a seer wins the \ntest, she is shaken but otherwise unharmed. If a seer fails the test, she enters \ninvoluntary torpor. \nInsight and Torpor \nWhenever a seer enters torpor involuntarily (including through Insight shock), \nshe may experience an episode of Insight. She will forget most of what she sees when \nshe rises from torpor, just as she did when she first rose as a vampire, but some small \ndetails of the dreams or visions often remain. The Storyteller determines what the \nvampire sees and remembers in this state. \nCHAPTER \nTHREE: THE ksit UNLIFE \n111 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nInsight, Auspex and Dementation \nInsight and Auspex are complementary, while Insight and Dementation seem at \ntimes aligned and other times directly opposed to each other. A seer’s use of certain \nAuspex or Dementation powers may trigger an episode of spontaneous Insight, at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. For example, use of Spirit’s Touch might additionally reveal \nthe item’s value to an elder in the Jyhad, while Aura Perception might inexplicably \nindicate that a certain Kindred is somehow “important” to follow or Telepathy \nactually reveal a scene from the target’s past as viewed from her perspective. \nDementation also seems strangely connected to the powers of Insight, but in a more \nunwholesome fashion. For example, seers invoking Passim sometimes find that both they \nand their target get caught up in emotions stemming from a memory of times past, while \nat least one canny seer has used Voice of Madness only to find himself sharing some of his \nown visions with his target. As for those seers fond of using Eyes ofchaos to divine the \nstrategies of the elders, well.. . suffice it to say that when it comes to such a grand design \nas the Jyhad, the abyss gazes back at the seer as well, sometimes with crippling results. \nNEW MFRIT5AND FLAWS \nYou must take one of the two generational Flaws to play one of the Last \nGenerations; you receive the normal amount of Traitsfor it, although they also count \nTHE ANARCH CUIDL \n112 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntoward the total seven Traits’ worth of Flaws that you may take at character creation. \nTaking either of these two Generational Flaws prohibits you from also taking the \nGeneration Background. If you take the Fourteenth Generation Flaw, you may also \ntake the Thin Blood Flaw if you wish. Many, but not all, fourteenth-generation \nvampires are also thin-blooded. \nIf you take the Fifteenth Generation Flaw, on the other hand, you may not also \ntake the Thin Blood Flaw. The cost and effects of the Thin Blood Flaw are already \nfigured into the cost of the Fifteenth Generation Flaw, though take care to read its \nwording precisely, as it differs slightly from the standard Thin Blood Flaw. \nFourteenth Generation (2-Trait Physical Flaw) \nYou were sired just a few years ago by a member of the thirteenth generation. \nAlthough your Blood Pool is the same as that of a thirteenth-generation vampire, you \ncan use only eight of your Blood Traits to heal wounds, raise Physical Attributes or \nfuel Disciplines that require vitae. You can still use the remaining two Blood Traits \nnormally for other purposes, including rising each night, creating and sustaining \nghouls, creating progeny and creating Blood Bonds, though your attempts to bond \nanother do not always succeed, at the Storyteller’s discretion. You take aggravated \ndamage from sunlight and suffer a normal chance of Rotshreck when exposed to it. \nFifteenth Generation (4-Trait Physical Flaw) \nYou are among the last in the long line of Caine’s descendants. Your vitae is so \nweak that you may use only six of your ten Blood Traits to heal wounds, fuel Disciplines \nor raise your Physical Attributes, but the cost for all these actions is doubled. For \nexample, raising your Physical Attributes by one Trait requires you to expend two \nBlood Traits rather than one. Rising each night still requires you to spend only one \nBlood Trait, however. You can use your remaining four Blood Traits to survive through \nthe day and rise each night, but nothing more. You cannot sire progeny, nor can your \nblood create ghouls or a blood bond, although it is possible for you to have children in \nthe normal fashion (albeit very rarely). Sunlight inflicts only lethal damage on you, \ninstead of aggravated damage as it does to other vampires. You can consume normal \nfood and drink and hold it down for about an hour or so before vomiting it up. \nThin Blood (4-Trait Physical Flaw) \nYou are one of the growing number of thin-blooded vampires whose cominx was \nforetold in the Book of Nod. The Curse of Caine is weak in you: while you suffer all the \nill effects of your vampiric condition, you do not receive all its benefits. You may expend \nBlood Traits to heal wounds, fuel Disciplines or raise your Physical Attributes, but all \ncosts for these actions are doubled. Your vitae is so weak that it cannot create blood \nbonds, nor can it create or sustain ghouls. Should you attempt to create progeny, the \nEmbrace has little chance of succeeding. Make a Simple Test when you try to sire a new \nvampire: If you win, the Embrace succeeds normally. If you tie or lose, however, the \nEmbrace fails, and your would-be childe is just an inconvenient mortal corpse. \nCharacters of generations lower than fourteenth may also take Thin Blood, but \nthey cannot invent new Disciplines (at least not as the Last Generations can) and \nthey cannot take the Insight Background. \nCHAPILRTHKE: THL RLBEL UNUK \n1 I3 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPersonal Masquerade (3-Trait Social Merit) \nCongratulations! You’ve managed to convince your local Kindred or Cainite \ncommunity that you’re actually a full member of a clan, despite your true ancestry. \nBeing accepted in this fashion means you are treated like a full member of undead \nsociety, rather than the half-person you are normally considered to be without this \nMerit. Exactly which clan you claim to hail from depends on you, but regardless you \nhad best be prepared to maintain this illusion at all times - \none slip and things can \nget very unpleasant in a hurry. Even being clanless is still considered better than \ntrying to pass yourself off as one of true lineage - \nand most clans aren’t exactly \nforgiving toward those who fool them in this fashion. \nRavaging Years (2-Trait Supernatural Flaw) \nThe Curse of Caine did not grant you immortality. You still age, albeit very slowly \n-perhaps one mortal year for every 20 calendar years you survive. The effects of this \nFlaw are not readily noticeable to you or others, but eventually you will grow old and \ndie, though not likely before you have suffered considerably from your decrepitude. \nSometimes, however, your aging process accelerates: like aghoul deprived ofvitae, your \ndeferred aging can return suddenly. Whenever you heal a Health Level of aggravated \ndamage, you age an entire year in the course of a single day’s sleep. This may not seem \nlike much of an inconvenience, but the effects can add up fast if your unlife is plagued \nby frequent exposure to sunlight or other sources of aggravated damage, and eventually \nyour immortality will become a wizened thing indeed. \nHemetic (4-Trait Mental Flaw) \nYou find the very idea of drinking blood repulsive: in fact, just thinking about \nit makes you physically ill, an inconvenient problem for a vampire. In order to hold \nthe vitae you consume within your system until you absorb it, you must make a Static \nPhysical Challenge against six Traits immediately after feeding. Failure means the \nsudden, humiliating and extremely messy expulsion of all newly consumed Blood \nTraits as you vomit them up. The only way to avoid the nausea is to feed while \nfrenzying. When your Beast takes control, you can keep down any blood that you \nconsume. Feeding while in frenzy, in addition to being almost as messy as retching \nup vitae, can endanger the Masquerade, bringing you a lot of unwanted attention \nfrom the scourge or sheriff. \nClan Weakness (2-Trait Supernatural Flaw) \nAlthough you are a Caitiff, you still suffer from your clan’s natural weakness. \nWhile this can help you pass yourself off as a member of the appropriate clan, it can \nalso be dangerous if you’re not aware of it-or \nhow other vampires might react to it, \ndepending on the weakness. This Flaw can prove misleading to those vampires who \nbelieve that evidence of a clan weakness can pinpoint the Caitiffs ancestry: some \nCaitiff spontaneously replicate a clan weakness, with no connection to its lineage. \nDecrepitude (3-Trait Supernatural Flaw) \nWhen you suffer aggravated damage, the Curse of Caine doesn’t always succeed \nat repairing the injuries. Every time you heal an aggravated wound, you must engage \nin a Physical Test against a number of Traits equal to 5 plus the number of Health \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n1 I4 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nLevels of aggravated wounds you suffered (for example, if you suffered the loss of 2 \nHealth Levels from aggravated damage, the difficulty would be 7). Failing the test \nmeans that, although you regain your lost Health Levels, your body still shows signs \nof the damage. Burned hair may not grow back, and wounds may leave scars. Visible \ndamage may require you to take the Negative Trait Repugnant; a failed test following \nunusually severe or massive damage may result in the loss of Physical and !3ocial \nTraits, at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nFangless (2-Trait Physical Flaw) \nSomething went wrong during your Embrace, and the Curse of Caine made you \na vampire but left you without fangs. (How embarrassing!) You must use a knife, \nsyringe, or other sharp instrument to extract the vitae you need to survive. This Flaw \ncan lead to serious problems in hunting and feeding, as few mortals find such \nexsanguination pleasant, though the Kiss proceeds as normal once you place your \nmouth to the wound. The absence of fangs also removes your only natural means of \ninflicting aggravated damage. \nSuperstition (Variable) \nMany of those who make up the Last Generations have no other means of learning \nwhat it means to be a vampire apart from books, movies and television. That includes \nthe things that can cause them harm. The supernatural effects of the Embrace can give \nsuch delusions the power to hurt or even kill those who suffer from them. A vampire \nwho expects to be repelled by crosses because that’s what happens to all the vampires \nin the movies may suffer real damage from touching a crucifix. Can’t Cross Running \nWater, Cast No Reflection and Repulsed by Garlic are good examples of such Flaws. \nOthers include compulsively counting objects thrown in your path, being repulsed by \nwild rose, only feeding from a particular area of the body or even believing that all. your \nvampiric powers depend on carrying or wielding a particular item. Storytellers should \nuse the existing Flaws as guidelines for determining the Trait value of a particular \nsuperstition, and as a rule a Kindred confronted by his superstitious weakness must \nspend a Willpower Trait to actively overcome his debility. \nADDITIONAL \nTHIN-BLOODED \nRULF’~ \nAnomalous Biological Activity and Aging \nWhenever a thin-blooded vampire heals a level of aggravated damage, he may \nexperience spontaneous reactivation of minor aspects of his mortal metabolism: \ngrowing stubble, feeling hungry for real food, spitting real saliva and so on. Whether \nor not this occurs and how it manifests is at the discretion of the Storyteller. Note that \nwhile a little anomalous biological activity may help fool witch-hunters, many elders \ncan’t stand seeing this sort of thing and tend to react badly to it. Regardless of any \nanomalous activity, however, thin-blooded vampires do not actually age unless they \npossess the Ravaging Years Flaw. \nWaking U p  \nDespite rumors to the contrary, thin blood provides no inherent advantage or \ndisadvantage in awakening or acting during the daytime. \nCHAPTLRTHW: \nTHE RIBEL UNLIFL \n115 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHILDREN \nOFTHF LIVING \nAND THF UNDFAD \nDHAMPIRS \nA dhampir is something that should not be, something that the Kindred and \nCainites of the world believed could not exist: the offspring of amortal and avampire. \nIt shouldn’t be possible, but it is ... very, very rarely. A fifteenth-generation vampire \nof either gender can conceive half-mortal offspring, which develop and are born in \nthe normal fashion. Gypsy folklore calls such creatures “dhampirs,” and the term is \nrapidly becoming known in the circles of scholarly Kindred everywhere. \nBy their very nature, all dhampir are young, the oldest no more than twenty. The \nthin-blooded vampires are very much a product of the Final Nights, and so the \ndhampirs postdate the youngest generations. They spend most of their lifetimes \namong normal, contemporary mortals, mostly unaware of their unusual heritage. The \ntruth, when and if it comes, is almost always a shattering revelation. \nMost vampires have never heard of dhampirs, and those few who have are ready \nto scoff at the ludicrousness of the notion. (“Vampires impregnating mortals? \nImpossible!”) But already a few of these walking contradictions have found their way \ninto the Anarch Movement. They number barely a handful, but the Anarch \nMovement regards dhampirs as the ultimate wild card: they’re not supposed to exist \nbut they do, and therefore they should be welcomed. Predictably, some anarchs desire \nonly to exploit this valuable new resource. Others, particularly the more studiously \ninclined, see the dhampirs as proof that the Final Nights have not only arrived but \nhave parked their cycles at the curb. These Cainites often react with awe and hope \nwhen they encounter a dhampir, and try to make her welcome within the ranks of \nthe Movement. \nDHAM~IR \nCHARACTER \nCREATION \nDisciplines \nLike ghouls, dhampirs begin play with Prowess, the first Basic Potence power. But \nthey have no clan Disciplines, and therefore they may also have one additional Basic \npower in any of the following Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, \nFortitude, Obfuscate, Potence or Presence. Dhampirs always pay out-of-clan costs for \nDisciplines, and can never raise any Discipline above the Basic level (even if a \ndhampir becomes a ghoul). \nVirtues \nAll dhampirs without exception follow the Path of Humanity, and assignvirtue \nTraits just like any other mortal character. It is theoretically possible that a dhampir \ncould learn to embrace one of the Paths, but that would require prolonged exposure \nto individuals and events that would almost certainly guarantee the dhampir’s \ndestruction. \nTHL ANARCH \nGUIDE \n116 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWillpower \nDhampirs start with two Willpower Traits. \nMerits and Flaws \nThe full range of Merits and Flaws is available to dhampirs. However, they \ncannot have Merits and Flaws that apply only to vampires. For example, a dhampir \ncannot have the Fangless Flaw, because dhampirs do not have fangs. Dhampirs also \nhave access to two exclusive Merits and Flaws (see below). \nBlood Traits \nDhampirs actually create their own (albeit weak) vitae. They have ten I3lood \nTraits, and regenerate one per day. A dhampir can also drink vampiric vitae and \nregain lost Blood Traits more quickly, but ingesting just one such Trait meam that \nthe dhampir is one-third of her way toward a full Blood Bond, and they do noi: gain \nany additional powers from being a ghoul. \nFreebie Traits \nDhampirs receive eight Freebie Traits to spend on additional Traits or Merits, \nDhampir Characteristics \nDhampirs and ghouls share the same standard abilities and limitations, excepted \nas noted in this chapter. They can use Blood Traits to raise their Physical Traii:s, for \nexample, and expend a Willpower Trait to refresh any Attribute Trait category. \nplus whatever other Free Traits they may gain from Flaws or Negative Traits. \nCHAPIER THREE: THE BEL UNLIR \n117 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDHAMPIR \nMERITSAND \nFLAWS \nPerceive Vampires (2- or 5-Trait Supernatural Merit) \nLegends passed down from generation to generation by certain Gypsy families, \nparticularly those that spent time in the Slavic lands, hold that dhampirs can always \nrecognize a vampire for what she is. Note that a dhampir’s first recognition of a \nvampire, and the implication of what she sees, could be a terrible shock to her mental \nequilibrium. \n2-Trait Merit: You can automatically recognize a vampire, regardless of Merits \nsuch as Blush of Health, thaumaturgical rituals, makeup or any other attempt the \ntarget vampire makes to conceal his true nature. Mask ofa Thousand Faces fools your \nsenses into believing whatever image is projected, but you are still aware that the \nindividual projecting the image is a vampire. You can also sense that vampires hidden \nby Obfuscate are lurking nearby, though not exactly where they might be. In addition, \nthe powers of particularly ancient and clever vampires may still fool you, at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. \n5-Trait Merit: You automatically pierce any attempt at disguise. Even the most \nformidable Obfuscate powers of the Ancients are immaterial: you always recognize any \nvampire for what she is, regardless of any attempt she makes to hide or disguise herself. \nFragile Bones (5Trait Physical Flaw) \nMany of the same legends about dhampirs also say they have thin and brittle \nbones. For you, bashing damage is treated as lethal damage. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n118 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPIERTHREE: \nTHE RIBEL UNLFI \n119 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe price of freedom is eternal vigilance. \n- \nThomas Jefferson \nPLAYING \nA UNIQUF \nANARCH \nThe previous chapters in this book provided you with an overview of the \nanarchs’ history, information on creating viable anarch characters, creating 5tories \nfor anarchs and insight into the nightly affairs of the Movement. By now you’re \nprobably thinking, “That all sounds great, but how can I actually do it during game \nsessions?” This chapter helps you make it all happen. Everybody knows, that \ncharacters are the most important aspect of any Mind’s Eye Theatre story. This \nchapter provides what you’ll need to take your character beyond the anarch \nstereotypes and transform her into a believable persona. \nTALKING \nTHF TALK \nTHINKING \nLIKE \nAN ANARCH \nAs you form a mental picture of the various aspects of your character’s behavior \nand personality, try to get into the anarch mindset and take note of those elements \nthat will aid you in making sure your character retains her individuality. Stop \nthinking of your character as just an “anarch”- that’s only the first layer of character \ndevelopment - \nand start thinking of her as an individual who, among other things, \nis an adherent of the ideals of the Anarch Movement. She’s also got apersonal history \nthat intersects somewhere with her political and social views to create motivations \nfor her behaviors. She’s also a member of a clan that helps define and determine :some \nCHAPTER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n121 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof her behaviors and attitudes. And she has goals she intends to accomplish that \naffect how she’ll approach the details of her night-to-night existence. \nTHE GENERATION \nGAP \nThe Young and the Relentless \nThe revolutionary fire burns brightly in the hearts and minds of the Anarch \nMovement’s younger members, and with good reason: they are often the most deeply \naffected by the Camarilla’s stifling adherence to the status quo. Unable to share in \nthe rewards of unlife because they were Embraced in the wrong century or into the \nwrong lineage, permanently frustrated in their ambitions by an immovable socio- \npolitical barrier, the fledgling anarchs understand that the Ivory Tower is little more \nthan a decaying shell. It must be pulled down so that a better structure can be built \natop its smoking ruins. Unfortunately for the Anarch Movement, this attitude is \nexactly what the Camarilla expects from the anarchs, and it generally gives even the \nmore moderate members of the Cause a bad name. \nThe prevailing stereotype claims that all younger anarchs gravitate toward \nviolence as an expression of their passions, and that many if not all are so frustrated \nby their situation that they simply aren’t willing to stop punching things long enough \nto listen to or consider other alternatives. This stereotype isn’t without its merits: \npassion and frustration often lead to action, and that action is frequently direct and \nviolent. The problem is compounded by the fact that a goodly number of younger \nanarchs are just that: young, both in terms of mortality and unlife. Mortals who \nexpect youth not to rebel are fooling themselves, and the same can be said in many \ncases among the Kindred. \nEmbraced recently enough to recall the intimate details of their breathing days, \nmany young anarchs developed something of a “vending machine mentality” when \nthey were alive: quarter goes in, candy comes out. Young mortals often expect their \nwishes and needs to be gratified instantly: imagine the rude shock they encounter \nwhen, after being Embraced, they discover a shadow society they never knew existed \nin which their wishes and needs automatically take a backseat to those of the Kindred \nin power. Is it any wonder that mortals raised on the milk of democratic rhetoric and \ntaught that their ancestors fought wars to gain the right to self-determination will \nrankle, possibly even start breaking things, when they are forced into subservient \nroles by virtue of what seems an arbitrary set of factors? Unfortunately, most elders \nand even the ancillae have forgotten what it was to be a young mortal, and cannot \nidentify with their progeny on these points. They tend to react harshly to the \nobjections of the young, and this breeds even more resentment in those who could \nideally benefit from the wisdom of their sires. \nHow will you reflect this revolutionary zeal in your portrayal of your character, \nparticularly if you’re playing in a Masquerade game that’s focused on one of the two \nlarger sects? She could start by breaking things or punching other Kindred, and that will \ncertainly get her some attention. But it will also get her butt kicked if she keeps it up, \nand it might even get her reduced to a thin layer of ashes floating on the nearest body \nof water. Even the most lenient and flexible of sires, primogenor princes will eventually \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngrow weary of an anarch who seems determined to live up to the worst stereotypes \navailable, and once they reach that point your character’s continued existence is in \nserious jeopardy! Worse, continued in-character violence, even in the pursuit of a valid \ncharacter concept, more often than not leads to building resentment and problems \nbetween players. The last thing your game needs is for its players to be at one another’s \nthroats over issues of character interaction: that can bring a game session to a flaming \nhalt, and even destroy an entire chronicle if it’s allowed to continue. \nSo how can you portray the angry fires of youth without necessarily attacking all \nthe other player characters your anarch meets? It’s entirely possible to play a joung, \nzealous and deeply committed member of the Anarch Movement without having \nyour character try to bum down the Elysium. The realities of the live-action \nenvironment are that your character must somehow coexist with the other player \ncharacters, even if it means finding alternatives to what might seem the natural \noutlet for her inner outrage. Working openly as a reformer, or undercover as a mole, \nare two of the best approaches. You can still work toward destroying everything the \nother characters hold dear without alienating all the other players if you’re willing \nto accept that some in-character behaviors - \nhowever legitimate for your character \n- \ndon’t work as well as others in this type of game. \nMaybe your character heaps scorn and mockery on the heads of Camarilla-loyal \nKindred, but she might opt to do so subtly and mostly in the company of those who \nare likely to find her observations and barbs either amusing or telling. While she \nmight prefer to glory in the outright destruction of the status quo, she could also prove \nvery effective by turning every conversation to the topic of gaining opportunities for \nredistribution of power and resources. However she dedicates herself to tearing down \nthe walls that separate the privileged from the masses, think about how you might \nportray these attitudes during actual game sessions. \nKeep in mind, however, that even if your character is an inveterate firebrand and \nadvocate of direct action, starting fights every time the Kindred meet in the Elvsium \nisn’t going to win many friends for the Movement or be a lot of fun for other players \nand Storytellers. Perhaps your character is bound by obligation or duty to find a \nmeans ofcoexisting with the other characters in your chronicle. Or maybe she’s going \nundercover to take the measure of the prince and his cronies. \nYou probably claim to have broken free of the Camarilla: how will you react if the \nSabbat or Cathayans attack the Ivory Tower in your vicinity? Strange as it may seem, \nanarchs are often first to man the front lines of defense against invaders and ather \nthreats. The reasons for this seemingly contradictory attitude are complex, but at the \nheart of the matter is the fact that if the Camarilla were destroyed tonight, the anarchs \n(those who weren’t destroyed along with the sect, that is) would have nothing left to \nreform. Many anarchs do not see themselves as the literal enemy of the Camarilla, as \nmuch as those who will redefine the sect and its institutions. Anarchs who turn their \nbacks on the Camarilla Kindred in their time of need cannot hope to persuade them \nto listen to alternative notions of governance in times of peace. \nFinally, how will coming to terms with your unliving nature influence how you \nsee and act for the Cause? Playing a young Cainite means not only finding your \nCHAPTER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKJNG \n123 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncharacter’s place in the Anarch Movement, but also portraying her reactions to the \neffects of the Embrace and the slow erosion of her old morality. Roleplaying an \nanarch affords you an opportunity to go beyond all the mental stereotypes associated \nwith this type of character. But don’t forget that while you may style yourself as one \nof the “good guys” in the fight against the elders’ tyranny, your character still shares \nsome fundamental traits with the enemy. Namely, you’re both undead creatures of \nthe night, requiring the blood of the living to sustain yourselves. Try not to lose sight \nof this when constructing your persona: all Kindred and Cainite characters share this \ninherent flaw, and no matter how much they want to believe themselves heroes, they \nmust still face the fact of the Beast and the toll it takes on their souls. \nOlder and Wiser \nYou still feel the fire in your gut, but sometimes it starts to die down as you \ncontemplate the long years of fighting behind you, not to mention the long years of \nfighting that lie ahead. It’s wearying, and some nights you wonder how you keep \ngoing. Then you remind yourself of the Camarilla’s innumerable betrayals of your \nideals, and force yourself to recall the faces of those who perished at the hands of \nKindred determined to remove any threats to their precious comforts and status. It’s \nnot much, but it helps. \nWhile there are neonate anarchs dedicated to peaceful forms of rebellion, and \ndedicated elders who are still convinced despite all evidence to the contrary that violence \nis the best and only option, it’s uncommon for an anarch who has been around the block \na time or two to still believe that hard-core agitation is the best path to reform. Anarchs \nwho have paid their dues on the front lines and in the trenches tend to be more moderate \nthan their younger compatriots and spend alot more time among the Kindred. There they \noften seek to call on the like-minded to join them in rebuilding the sect’s policies as more \nrealistic and functioning models, using their hard-won experience to underscore their \narguments. Although these examples of political moderation are more accepted in the \nIvory Tower’s salons and courts than their louder kin, the attitudes and behaviors that \nenable this concession from the Camarilla sometimes create backlash within the Anarch \nMovement. Simply put, the inexperienced and fair-weather anarchs sometimes lose faith \nin the dedication of their more experienced comrades because they don’t agree on the \nsame methods of bringing about change. \nIn a chronicle that’s organized around either the Camarilla or the Sabbat, the \nexperienced anarch - \nor the younger anarch with a more moderate attitude - \ncan \noften be the best choice of character. It still affords you the same range of \nopportunities for dramatic roleplaying, but you get the chance to play a character \nwith a longer potential life expectancy. And the truth is that while the bomb-tossing, \nmotorcycle-riding, nine-millimeter-shooting young thug is the stereotype that leaps \nto mind when discussing anarchs, the more moderate anarchs are at least equal in \nnumber to their violence-prone counterparts. Should you choose to make your \nanarch character a veteran of the Movement’s many conflicts, you’ll automatically \nbring a certain cachet to the cause. Making it clear through your actions that you’re \nabout reform and not about mindless destruction will help you score points among \nthe Kindred and Cainites you’re trying to influence. \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n1 24 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nYour methods will be easily distinguished from those of the agitators: in cornpari- \nson, you’ll seem more like a diplomat to the Kindred and less like a thug. Because you \nknow from experience that the Camarilla won’t bend to the pressures that the Anarch \nMovement can bring to bear from outside the Ivory Tower, you’ve elected to work \ntirelessly for change from within. Whether you pursue this agenda openly as one of the \nloyal opposition, or in a more clandestine fashion as a mole, your character will have \nample opportunity to sink her fangs into the meat of the conflict between the Camarilla \nand the Anarch Movement. Every game session will give you new chances to pursue \nyour agenda, and your fellow players will thank you for not starting a new hour-long \ncombat every time the prince blinks funny at one of the local revolutionaries. \nBut just because you’ve decided on this more moderate approach to pursuing the \nanarchs’ goals doesn’t mean you’re going to have an easy time of it. In fact, your lot might \nbe at least as difficult as that of the anarchs with amore violent stripe: they’ve voluntarily \nseparated and differentiated themselves from the Kindred, but you’re going to look to \nmany Licks like you’re trying to have your vitae and eat it too. By attempting to persuade \nthe Kindred that the anarchs have a valid point, you will be the butt of numerous jokes \nand more than a little ridicule. What progress you make on your agenda will be measured \nby inches, and you may well suffer more setbacks than successes in the name of the Cause. \nWhat will you do to keep your inner fire stoked? Where will you find the strcmgth \nand inspiration that will enable you to force others to see the truth and get in the fight? \nOneofthegreatestassets youpossessis thesame thingthatenabledyou toreach thispoint: \npatience. Your character knows full well that the Kindred cannot and will not be rushed: \nchange, if it occurs at all within the Ivory Tower, comes slowly, and only those who are \nwilling to wait for it will ever know its rewards. Be prepared to play the waiting game, and \nbe watchful for opportunities that the Cause can use to grow in strength and numbers. If \nyour chronicle includes younger, more volatile anarch characters, your character can be \nan invaluable resource for them, providing advice on how to stay alive in these turtlulent \nnights and support when things get difficult. Don’t be surprised if the agitators accuse you \nof selling out and brand you as one of the Kindred whom they believe they are struggling \nagainst: they’ll come around eventually, if they live that long. \nProbably the greatest danger to your continued affiliation with the Anarch \nMovement is your long exposure to the Camarilla. Think about this: if you’ve \nsurvived as a committed anarch for more than a few decades, you’ve doubtless seen \nthe way that the Camarilla Kindred live their unlives up close and personal. It’s \npossible that, after so many nights of struggle, you might begin to feel a bit envious \nof their comforts and privileges. And should you actually manage to gain even a small \namount of status or power within the Ivory Tower, you’ll inevitably suffer ternpta- \ntions, and not just the ones you might expect. Indeed, once you comprehend exactly \nwhat the elders have been trying to withhold from you and your fellow agitators, you \nmight have a decidedly difficult time giving it up. And that, of course, will lead to \npangs of conscience, and possibly even a backlash from other anarchs who rnight \nview your inner turmoil as a betrayal of all they hold sacred. If you’re lucky, lrou’ll \nstave off these temptations and carry on with your lofty goals; if not, you’ll probably \nend up becoming exactly what you once despised.. . and that’s fun to roleplay! \nCHAPTTR \nFOUR: RADKAL THINKJNG \n125 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWHATTHFHFLLARFYOUDOING? \nMOTIVATION \nLike it or not, nobody comes to the Anarch Movement by accident - \nand even \nif they did, they wouldn’t last long unless they found a good reason to fight against \nsome of the oldest, most powerful and deeply entrenched societies on the face of the \nplanet. What motivates your character, and what does she want to accomplish? You \nshould answer these questions before your character sets foot in her first Laws of the \nNight game, because you don’t want your character to be just another frustrated Lick \nwith an ax to grind. Instead, try to personalize your character so that the experience \nof roleplaying her is meaningful and fun, for you and your fellow players. Anybody \ncan throw together a Brujah bruiser in three minutes and slap the “Anarch label on \nit, but the one-dimensional result is not only unsatisfying to play, it does a disservice \nto the story, your fellow players and the anarchs themselves. Every character should \nbe believable and unique, because that enables both player and character to make a \npositive contribution to the story. The more attention you pay to this exercise, the \neasier it will be for your Storyteller to weave your character into the plots and events \nof the chronicle. \nPast Imperfect \nYou devised a history when you first created your character, and you’ll use this \nto springboard your motivations. Start with your character’s mortal life. Who were \nTHE ANARCH GIDE \n126 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nyou before you became a vampire? Were there circumstances that might predispose \nyou to the aims of the Anarch Movement? Maybe you’ve always been something of \na reformer, using your time and energy to create a better world, or at least to oppose \ngroups and individuals that seem intent on garnering power and money .at the \nexpense of others. Some anarchs doubtless choose their progeny from the ranks of \nmortal reformist and dissident groups, and the last four decades have been marked \nwith numerous worthy causes in which your character might have been involved. \nMaybe you marched and practiced civil disobedience for civil rights in the 1960s, or \ntook to the streets to protest economic globalization in the 1990s. You mighi: have \nbeen a campus radical or anti-war demonstrator in the turbulent 1970s, or an \nenvironmental activist in the industrial madhouse of the 1980s. Connection.i with \nany of these might be reflected during play through your attire, language or behavior. \nWhen you’re comfortable with the circumstances of your mortal background, \nmove on to the post-Embrace events of your unlife. At some point, you lost your belief \nin the validity of the sects (if you ever had any). When and why did this happen? Try \nto pinpoint exactly what it is about this rotting shell of the vampires’ socio-political \nstructure that makes your character so angry or resentful. The reality of such one- \nsided partisan politics stirs something in the heart, mind and gut of the anarch. \nPerhaps your character was Embraced into circumstances that brought these lessons \nhome fast and hard early in her existence among the Kindred - \nthis happens most \nfrequently to Caitiff, Malkavians, Nosferatu and other “outsider” clans and tdood- \nlines who find themselves holding the short end of the Camarilla’s social stick. \nIt can also occur with characters of more “acceptable” lineage, such as the \nToreador, Tremere and Ventrue: anyone who feels alienated and frustrated tiy the \nartificial limitations of her society can experience the desire to restructure her \nenvironment more favorably. Perhaps the prince didn’t even bother with a token \nattempt to disguise his pro-elder favoritism and blatant cronyism, and this rankled \nyour sensibilities to the point where you got fed up and started thinking aboui: how \nto change things for the better. So long as you have some idea what this pivotal event \nin your character’s unlife was, that willgo a long way toward establishing why she acts \nthe way she does now. \nTHE DEPORTMENT \nDEPARTMENT \nRealize and accept that from the moment the Kindredor the Brothers and Sisters \nof Caine discover that you’ve thrown in your lot with the Anarch Movement, they \nwill make any number of assumptions and judgments about you personally as well as \nyour nature, goals and behavior. Many Kindred will expect you to stride intcr, the \nElysium waving a placard that reads “Social Justice Now!” And maybe that’s exactly \nwhat you had in mind, since a little agitprop sometimes gets the attention of irhose \nwho might be interested in your cause. But it also confirms all of the Kindred’s worst \nsuspicions about you, and by extension all other anarchs. If this is the way you wish \nto go, be prepared not only for the stinging lash of the harpy’s tongue, but to let such \ntaunts and insults slide without visible effect -starting a fight in Elysium is a quick \nticket out of the city, and never forget most Camarilla members are just waiting for \nCHAPIER FOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n127 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nan excuse to send you packing (or worse). If your pride can’t handle that kind of abuse, \ndon’t bother showing up, because a single slip could easily cost you a lot more than \nyou bargained for. In extreme circumstances, radical couture might earn you an \nimmediate visit from the Keeper, which you had best handle carefully because it \nmight well end with you being tossed out of the building and into the cold, wet night. \nIf you routinely get thrown out of the Elysium before you have an opportunity to \ninteract with other Kindred, have you really accomplished anything of value? \nBeing mindful of how you appear in the eyes of the sects could one night save \nyour unlife. To the Camarilla, at best you’re a whining, spoiled and sometimes \namusing brat who will eventually give over her temper tantrum and return to the fold, \nafter a few decades have removed the bloom from the revolutionary rose. At worst, \nyou’re a subversive traitor to be rooted out and exposed with a zeal that echoes the \nMcCarthy witch hunts for Communists in the 1950s. The only thing in your favor \nis that you generally maintain the Masquerade (if you’re smart, that is), and you’ve \nmanaged to gamer notable support from many Gangrel who were once members of \nthe sect. The Sabbat is even less charitable. To the Brothers and Sisters of Caine, \nyou’re an undisciplined, untutored rabble that’s as much a tool of the Antediluvians \nand the Sabbat’s chief enemy, the Camarilla. Worse, your doctrine seems to promote \n-to the Sabbat mindset - \nexcessive freedom without any responsibility, and that \nis something the Sword of Caine cannot abide or permit. Sabbat elders understand \nthat it’s foolish to insist on equality when the generational differences in blood \npotency automatically create inherent distinctions among Cainites. \nIt won’t escape you that that this viewpoint is startlingly close to that held by \nmany Camarilla elders, indicating that there’s less to choose from between the two \nsides than either of them would care to admit. But we already know that - \nso let’s \ngo on to the business of how to craft the image your anarch seeks to project. \nDressing the Part \nTake another look at your character history. Are there any identifiable clothing \ntrends from the period of your Embrace that you can use to help personalize your \ncharacter? The best sources of inexpensive costume pieces are your local vintage \nclothing and secondhand stores. Were you a flower child or a disco king in your \nbreathing days? You needn’t spend a fortune recreating a vintage 1960s wardrobe: \njust a few items, such as a colorful flower-print skirt and a beaded headband, are \nsufficient to give the sense of the time and place. Green hair and a denim jacket \ndecorated with a few well-chosen buttons could suggest the punk streets of London \nin the 1980s, while a flannel shirt and Doc Martens conjure up the grunge look of the \nearly 1990s. When in doubt, go to the library or online and look up fashions for the \ndesired time period. \nAlso think about how you want to be perceived, what missions you may be \nundertaking from night to night, and how these factors might affect your sartorial \nstyle. Will you be rousing the rabble when you’re not flinging Molotov cocktails at \nthe prince’s haven? You’ll want durable but flashy clothes and thick-soled boots for \nextra height, maybe a bold hair color and couple of tattoos that symbolize your anger \ntoward the status quo. Are you the baron’s emissary to the prince? Go for a well- \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n128 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngroomed and personable look that thwarts the Kindred’s expectations of anarchs. Try \nchinos and a sport coat, velvet, silk, a tailored outfit or even a business suit, and \nleather shoes are a must - \nnobody pays attention to ambassadors who wear dirty \ntennis shoes. Moles tend to dress in whatever styles are accepted throughout the \nsociety they’re trying to blend into, and in contrast to most anarchs they favor subtle \ntouches that bespeak the eras of their birth or Embrace. Bruisers usually like to \nindicate their willingness to mix it up through their choice of wardrobe, and thus \nthey’re rarely found wearing anything other than jeans and T-shirts with a denim or \nleather jacket. Barons should avoid dressing like the Camarilla princes they’re mying \nnot to emulate, without going so far to the other end of the spectrum that they end \nup looking like the punks everybody else believes the anarchs to be. Try clean blue \njeans paired with a button-down work shirt and sturdy boots. \nProps \nYou probably won’t be carrying placards that read “Impeach the prince!” \nthrough the Elysium (unless you’re really looking to get your butt kicked), but you’ll \nstill want to give some thought to personal props that help you establish your \ncharacter’s identity in the minds of your fellow players. \nFirebrands and those who would bring the truth of the Anarch Movement to the \nmasses might carry a well-thumbed paperback copy of their favorite politi- 1-a 1 or \nphilosophical work, whether it’s Karl Marx’s The Communist Manifesto or I’lato’s \nUtopia, with plenty of notes in the margins to suggest they’ve done more than just wave \nit in the faces of the elders. Fairly or not, glasses naturally suggest a degree of \nsophistication and intelligence that can be helpful when portraying an emissary or \nother anarch with a desire to stand apart from the rabble. Blacking a few teeth can add \na lot to a Nosferatu or Samedi, or just suggest a tougher, lower-class look to other clans. \nAnyone who has a lot of information to keep track of (barons, spies, tactical planners, \netc.) might want apocket notebook, leather portfolio or a PDA. Acharacter who might \nneed to pick up stakes quickly- say, a quartermaster, a Caitiff who hasn’t presented \nhimself to the prince or a Tremere whose Regent doesn’t know about her extracurricu- \nlar activities - \nprobably needs a canvas or leather satchel to carry all his gear. Don’t \nforget a cell phone or pager if you need to stay in touch with your buddies. \nSay That Like You Mean It \nThere’s not much point in trying to change the status quo if you never speak to \nanyone about it, is there? Some players prefer to spend their entire game se.jsions \nbrooding in the comer, but the “cool loner” actually isn’t of much use to the Anarch \nMovement. Most anarchs like to talk about their beliefs and goals. But difl’erent \nanarchs express themselves in different ways, and thinking about how your character \nspeaks and moves will help you really get into her shoes. \nThink about some of the situations you’re likely to be in during games and how \nyour character would act in them. Obviously you’re going to walk, sit, stand and talk \na great deal. But how? Firebrands and rabble-rousers don’t tiptoe through the \nElysium: they swagger with the air of a Cainite on a mission, sit with their arms spread \nwide to indicate self-assured control and gesture expansively while speaking in \nCHA~ER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n129 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n+l \ni \ne \nexcited tones to demonstrate their enthusiasm to others. They also probably have a \nfew favorite phrases or simple arguments for interrupting conversations or shutting \ndown smart-mouthed neonates, though they avoid using them too often at the risk \nof having them become little more than catchphrases. When angered, their eyes dart \naround, searching for threats, and their movements become fluid and dangerous like \na hunting cat. Drawing up to full height and standing with one’s shoulders as broad \nas possible indicates strength, confidence and power without saying a word, and \nbroad gestures help convey passion even in the most normal exchanges, though be \ncareful to avoid overdoing them and draining them of their meaning. \nBy contrast, the emissary’s behavior is very low-key. Her posture is straight, her \nexpression pleasant or at worst neutral, and her tone is measured and respectful. She’s \ncharged with building bridges between anarchs and Kindred, so she chooses her \nwords carefully, never interrupts and listens patiently while others have their say. \nShe’s reluctant to fight, but if she must she seeks to damage her opponent enough to \nallow herself to escape. Keep your chin up to maintain an air of dignity (though not \npainfully high, as that suggests arrogance), and avoid crossing your arms in favor of \nleaving them in your lap or working on something with your hands. Keep your body \nlanguage close to yourself, with few large or sudden gestures, focusing instead on \nperfecting small, graceful movements. Avoid slang or profanity whenever possible, \nand select your words carefully so that they elicit the precise response you want \nwithout provoking unnecessary hostility or leaving them open to unwanted interpre- \ntations. When called upon to speak at court, use well-reasoned arguments as well as \na dose of fiery rhetoric, and convey it all with professional decorum in mind. You are \nnot some ranting radical, but a diplomat to a most dangerous nation, and thus while \nyou must convey enthusiasm and belief in your cause, going too far over the top is \nlikely to lose the respect of the very elders you seek to convince. \nThese are both short examples of how you can take a few vocal tricks and basic \nbody language modifications to convey a sense of a very different person than yourself \nfrom the very beginning. Take some time to build and practice a special way of \nspeaking and carrying yourself when you work on your character. Once you have that \nin mind, you can even begin thinking about how you can change these different \nfactors and common habits to reflect variations in your character’s mood, mental \nstate or even Nature and Demeanor. Don’t get discouraged if nobody comments \nabout your efforts right away; often other players take note of these things without \nmentioning them outright, even if they look on them favorably. It’s also possible you \nmay be doing it so well they don’t immediately recognize it’s not how you normally \nare! But with enough time, you’ll find that other players will come to distinguish \nthese unique mannerisms and identify them with your character in a way few other \nlive-action characters achieve. \nWALKING \nTHF WALK \nAnarch Missions \nYou’ve already expressed your character’s first goal, and elaborated by forming \none or more motivations based on your character’s relative age, circumstances of \nTHL ANARCH \nGUIDE \n130 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nunlife and possibly clan. The process of forming your character’s individual identity \nis nearly complete. The final step is to consider how your character will spend her \nnights, and that means thinking about the different ways in which she’ll interact not \nonly with the story but the other characters as well. Your character wants to \nencourage change, promote equality and redistribute power.. . but how? \nIf you’re playing in an all-anarch chronicle, your character won’t lack for \nmissions and other assigned activities. But in chronicles that focus mainly on the \nSabbat or the Camarilla, you’ll want to make sure that in addition to the other \nmotivations discussed in this chapter, your character also has a mission in her unlife. \nThe best missions are longdterm assignments that your character can undertake \ncontinuously as part of her night-to-night existence: these afford you the best \nroleplaying opportunities because they support your character’s continuous develop- \nment throughout the story. But one-shot and short-term missions can also be fun and \nadd spice to the game. A few of both types of assignments appear below. \nSetting Up Shop \nWhen anarchs roll into a new city, somebody has to have a look around. Scouting \nout the lay of the land is usually a prelude to determining whether or not the local \nauthority figures are currently greeting anarchs with open arms, loaded firearms or a \nreception somewhere in between these extremes. It’s usually wise to send one, two or \neven three anarchs into a city to check the situation, or maybe even to make ccntact \nwith a cell if one is known to exist. If your character is assigned the “take a peek” task, \nremember that while you and yours may call what you’re doing “scouting,” the local \nKindred or Cainites might call it “spying.” While the two activities are largely one and \nthe same, being accused and found guilty of the latter can carry consequences many \ntimes more unpleasant than the former. To be clear: failing to mention that you’re a \nmember of the Anarch Movement when you present yourself to the prince can and will \ncome back to haunt you. On the other hand, admitting your political affiliation openly \nwhen you first hit town can be equally disastrous, so it’s probably best to keep this under \nyour hat until you see which way the wind is blowing (which is what you’re supDosed \nto be doing in the first place, right?). \nShould you want to elicit the attention of potential recruits, you need to make \nyour presence known. If you’re fortunate enough to be enjoying the company of a \nnumber of fellow anarchs- preferably a large number -you might be able to simply \nwalk into the Elysium or other local Kindred hangout and say hello. If your group is \nsufficiently numerous, the Sheriff and her deputies probably can’t respond effect ively \nin short order, giving you time to have a look around. Of course, if you’ve chosen to \nenter the Elysium on your scouting mission, you can probably expect to be free from \noutright violence as long as you observe the same courtesy. Remember, the purpose \nof the scouting mission isn’t to wreak havoc or fire up the neonates, but to take a look \nat what you’re up against and make your presence known. Once they know you’re in \ntown, curious neonates and disgruntled Kindred will eventually seek you out if they \nare interested in hearing your pitch. \nIf you’re fortunate, the elders will do some of your recruiting for you. How they \nreact to your presence will tell you a great deal about them and how the city is run, \nCHA~ER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n131 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nso pay attention to their initial responses. The moment they realize you’re in town, \nsome of the conservative old bats will probably insist that their childer stay as far away \nfrom you as possible. The more paranoid among them might even arrange for their \nprimogen to issue an edict barring all the members of their clan against fraternizing \nwith the likes of you and your fellows. Don’t waste this golden opportunity to point \nout the bitter truth: the elders do not trust the younger generations, and are so fearful \nof losing their place that they are prepared to forbid mere interaction with their \nsupposed enemy. You can’t buy publicity like that for any money! \nWhat It Takes: Scouting missions can be undertaken by any anarch, but the \nmost successful usually rely on subtlety. Consequently, you’ll want Abilities like \nInwestigation, Security, Subterfuge, Stealth and Streetwise to see you through. At least \none member of the scouting party should have some Obfuscate for aiding in your \ndeparture from hot spots. \nRousing the Rabble \nWhether its more moderate members care to admit it or not, the Anarch \nMovement depends on rousing the passions of those who might be sympathetic to its \ncause, and one method of fueling that fire is to take the message directly to the masses. \nPublic discussion of the Anarch Movement’s hopes, ideals, goals and methods is part \nof recruitment. If nobody knows about the Cause, nobody’s going to join up, right? \nSo somebody must seek out and interact with potential recruits. \nSome anarchs never miss an opportunity to turn each conversation around to \nthe topic of the desperate need for greater equality among Cainites, and what the \nanarchs are doing to achieve it, regardless of the social situation or company. They \nreason that if they talk up the Cause often enough, eventually their words will fall \non the right ears. The drawbacks of this approach include being dismissed as a broken \nrecord and, more importantly, attracting the attention of authority figures who won’t \ntake kindly to your “subversive” dialogue. Other anarch characters, usually among \nthe youngest or most frustrated of their ilk, seekout gatherings of Kindred or Cainites \nand deliberately set about trying to instigate immediate and radical change by \nexhorting their fellows to rise up on the spot. \nIn ideal circumstances, your character would keep a low profile when proselytizing, \nmaybe hanging out in the parts of town usually frequented by younger Licks, in order to \nminimize the chances of getting caught. If you’re playing in a chronicle that permits your \ncharacter to engage in activities during the downtime between game sessions, there’s no \nreason your character can’t do exactly that. Your Storyteller will determine whether or \nnot you encounter any other vampires and the result of your interactions with them. \nIf you’re the type of firebrand who finds satisfaction in sounding the clarion call to \naction, you’ll probably find yourself with lots of opportunities to do that every time you \nset foot in a Kindred gathering. Chances are you won’t have to wait more than ten or \nfifteen minutes for an example of exactly why the time for political discourse is ended to \npresent itself. Whether it’s the prince calling for the primogen to assemble for yet another \nround of pointless bickering, or the announcement of yet more grants of status to the \nharpy’s supporters, it’s revolting and all one to you. Seize on these opportunities and use \nthem as object lessons for anyone who will listen - \npoint out precisely what happened \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n132 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand paint it terms that reflect poorly on the Camarilla’s power structure. Then suggest \nstrongly that anyone with ashred of conscience can’t possibly stand by and let such abuses \ncontinue. Try to convey something of your own passions to your listeners: use your tone \nof voice to show that you’re outraged on their behalf, be expressive as possible with your \nvocabulary and raise your fist in self-righteous anger when calling for action. \nDon’t be annoyed with your audience if they start to heckle and shout out \nquestions: this means you’ve engaged them in dialogue and have a genuine clppor- \ntunity to present them with some alternative points of view. (It’s when your targets \nignore you and walk away that you should feel peeved.) If you’re successful at getting \nKindred to listen to you, even for a few minutes, one of them will probably demand \nto know whether or not you’ve got any better ideas. The answer to their quesrion is \nan emphatic “Yes!” followed by a short list of bullet items that demonstrate you’re no \nfalse prophet. Be sure to include among your list of reforms pointed suggestions about \nhow the righteous fury of the oppressed should fall, swiftly and harshly, on any elders \nor authority figures that have recently annoyed you. Use inclusive language like “we” \nand “us” when addressing your listeners: you want to plant the suggestion in their \nminds that they are already on your side, and vice versa. If there are neonates among \nyour listeners, focus most of your attention on them and try to get their names so that \nyou can seek them out later for further discussion. \nYour aim is not just to inflame: you also want to incite. Try to convince your \nlisteners that the time for action isn’t tomorrow night or next week: it’s right now! \nIf you’re really good or really lucky, your targets will be so caught up in your stirring \nrhetoric that they will commit an act of rebellion immediately. Try to goad them into \ncommitting acts of property damage and violence against those who have been their \noppressors! But be alert for and ready to deal with the agents of the status quo when \nthey focus their attention on your activities. You’re agitating for an end to the power \nstructure on which their current security depends, and they won’t look kindly cn you \nfor that. Ideally you’ll have a buddy along for the ride who can stand lookout and \nmaybe even run interference, allowing you a few moments to pack up and get ‘out of \nharm’s way. Regardless, you’ll eventually run afoul of the local Sheriff or her deputies \n(or both, if you’re really unlucky), and be called upon to give some account of yourself \nand your activities. At that point you’re either going to have to shut up and move \nalong (for now) or refuse to be silenced. If you choose to fight, understand that push \nis going to come to shove, and unless you think you can hold your own against \nmultiple bruisers you’re going to be the shovee. \nWhat It Takes: Obviously, Physical Traits, Celerity and Fortitude are helpful in \nsurviving in this role long enough to do some good for the Movement. Also key to \nyour success are Social Traits that will help you seem appealing, or at least in earnest, \nto your targets. If you can field some Ability Traits such as Performance or Expsssion \nto make your message more palatable, so much the better. \nVox Populi \nAnother challenging (and again, very dangerous) assignment is being anemissary. \nIf you’re playing the local baron’s ambassador or herald, you’ve really got your work cut \nout for you. You’ll be sent to negotiate with the local prince whenever tensions between \nCHA~ER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n133 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe Kindred and anarchs flare up, and considering the state of affairs in the Ivory Tower, \nthe situation will almost always be tense. You might well be the only anarch that the \nKindred don’t want to kick the moment they set eyes on you. By the same token, you \nmay also be the anarchs’ only connection to the Camarilla that’s not automatically \nadversarial. This is a tough gig, so understand that in unfortunate circumstances either \nside might use you as a scapegoat: It should come as no surprise that creatures as \npassionate as Kindred sometimes tend to kill the messenger! But just because your \nassociates may view you as an expendable member of the Movement doesn’t mean you \nhave to share their interpretation of your role. By being good at what you do, you can \nlook forward to a long and successful career as a go-between, and you might even \nmanage to gain some status from both sides in the bargain.. . maybe. \nSince the anarchs are still nominally part of the Camarilla sect, you’ll often find \nyourself saddled with the unenviable task of trying to soothe ruffled feathers between the \nIvory Tower and the Movement. A large part of your responsibilities will include trying \nto mitigate the punishments meted out to anarchs who violate Camarilla law and custom. \nTo accomplish this, you need to know and understand these precepts as well as, if not \nbetter than, those who enforce them. The Law Ability could come in very handy when \npleading your case before an irate prince, as could a few Traits of CumriUa Lore and a \nthorough grounding in the Traditions. More importantly, spend some time observing the \nauthority figures with whom you’ll be negotiating and try to understand what motivates \nthem. You won’t have alot of trinkets to bargain with, so be sure to take advantage of any \nintelligence about the local Kindred that you can gather, and have at least one level of \nInvestigutiun so that you can dig for your own dirt if necessary. It would be very helpful to \nknow, for example, that the Kindred have been suffering at the hands of a Sabbat pack \nor a marauding Lupine, or that open tension exists between two members of the \nprimogen. Learning about such matters means keeping your ear to the ground and trying \nto create a network of your own informants who can supply you with such useful tidbits. \nIf you can’t establish your ownspies, you’ll have to pay or bribe the 1ocalNosferatu to help \nyou, and hope that someone else isn’t offering them even more to sell you out. \nBefore you appear in front of the prince to plead your case, think about this praxis \nand what you know about the one who holds it. Does the prince see herself as an \noverburdened manager of nightly Kindred affairs, or an Old World tyrant who rules \nby the right and power of his blood? If you can be persuasive and placating by turns, \nyou stand a fair chance of convincing either type of prince to mete out less severe \npunishments for minor infractions. For instance, with some eloquent persuasion you \nmight be able to arrange for the accused Cainite to offer a boon to the prince as a \nmeans of repayment, rather than suffering exile or execution. Be sure that the target \nof the prince’s wrath actually pays the piper, however, or you may find yourself not \nonly less effective in future missions but possibly standing surety for the negligent \nCainite. If the prince refuses to accept any of the more common forms of repayment, \ntry to determine exactly what he wants. If you’re lucky enough to speak for a baron, \nyou might have something with which to bargain: intelligence about local Sabbat \nactivities, resources and connections among the kine, or perhaps even knowledge \nabout something or someone that the prince or another influential Kindred desires. \nt-\ni\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n134 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nShould you represent only your fellow anarchs without the benefit of a baron’s power, \nyour own persuasive abilities may be all you have to barter with. \nWhat It Takes: Needless to say, a good selection of appropriate Social Traits is \nvital to your success as an emissary, as are Abilities that can help you persuade or beg \neffectively. Presence is the indispensable Discipline for ambassadors, though a little \nDominate to get past the low-end obstacles or some Auspex to watch the moods of \nthose you’re dealing with aren’t bad either. \nOut Come the Wolves \nSome anarch character concepts are built around the use of force as the most \neffective method of changing the status quo. You’ve already been warned aboui: what \nhappens to those who live by the sword, but if you’re determined to paint a target on \nyour head, that’s up to you. So what are the practicalities of taking away an asset of \nthe enemy and making it yours? \nFirst, do your homework. What or who is the target? Will you undertake the raid \nduring a game session or in the downtime? What tools or resources do you need ’Who \nowns what you’re trying to take or damage? How is it likely to be protected? \nUnplanned smash-and-grab missions rarely succeed, and the handful that do almost \nalways lead to vicious repercussions later. The same goes for burning down a haven, \ndestroying property owned by elders and hurting or killing ghouls who serve the \nKindred. All these activities are types of raids, and they should be undertaken only \nafter you’ve scoped out the enemy. You don’t want to pull into the parking garage \nwhere you planned to kick the stuffing out of a few ghouls who work for the Ventrue \nprimogen, only to find a meeting of the local chapter of the Big Bad Sabbat Pack. \nConsider less obvious targets. If security at the prince’s downtown office building \nis simply too tight, maybe the influences of his newest childe are more vulnerable. \nMaybe you can’t get into the Nosferatu-controlled sewers, but you can probably \nlocate and harass the homeless bums that keep the Sewer Rats abreast of news on the \nstreet. Use face-to-face interactions with other characters to ferret out the nature and \ntypes of their holdings. Don’t be afraid to make deals with other characters to gain \nthis kind of information: whether or not you honor your boons could go a long way \ntoward establishing your credibility with potential sources of useful dirt and gossip. \nNext, have a plan and stick to it. Know who is going to accomplish what task, \nand try to have some kind of contingency plan in case things go wrong. Work out your \nescape route in advance, maybe arranging for some diversionary tactics. Make the \nmost of your supernatural assets: review the Disciplines and Abilities available to you \nand identify those that can help you get the job done and then get out again. \nFinally, understand and accept that, with rare exceptions, the typical raid only \ninconveniences the target. Actually gaining possession of the target of your raid \nshould be only one of several goals. Raids (including unsuccessful ones) make noise \nand call attention to your cause. Be sure potential recruits hear about the raid, even \nif it’s too risky to cop to it personally. Raids also make great diversions. Mort: than \none anarch pack has seized its true target while the sheriff and deputies were trying \nto deal with a convenient street riot or property fire. \nCHAPTER \nFOUR: ~\nK\nA\nL\n \nTHINKING \n135 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWhat It Takes: Mental Traits are key for planning successful raids, as are \nBackgrounds such as Allies, Contacts and Influence. These help you check out \npotential targets and conceal your activities from the watchful eyes of the elders. Try \nsending an ally or retainer into an art gallery you think is owned by Kindred and tell \nhim to look for any obvious security devices or guards. Ask your contacts what’s been \nshaking lately among the city’s criminal element before you decide to whack that \nstreet dealer who’s one of the deputy’s little smack peddlers. Bureaucracy, Empathy \nand Investigation are helpful in wheedling useful information out of Kindred and kine, \nas are Auspex, Dominate and Presence powers. \nObviously the raiders themselves should be equipped to handle trouble: Make \nsure they’re well-stocked with Physical, Blood and Willpower Traits before they \nstrike. Every Discipline and power has its place in raiding: Obfuscate, Quietus and \nObtenebration can hide raiders as they’re getting in and out of the target location. \nNaturally, Celerity, Fortitude, Potence and Protean, backed up with Brawl, Melee, \nFirearms and Security Abilities, can make the difference between getting out alive \nand not getting out at all. \nShaken, Not Stirred \nSo you’re playing a Bond, huh? Then hang onto your vodka martini, because \nyou’re in for a dangerous ride. This kind of “fifth column” work requires you to \nbecome, at least outwardly, an example of what you’ve come to despise most, and so \nit’s generally not appropriate for Cainites who have less than a few decades of unlife \nunder their belts. You need to understand the workings of the sect you’re planning \nto infiltrate; otherwise you won’t be of much use to your comrades. Your target is \nusually the Camarilla, though it’s not impossible to worm your way into a Sabbat pack \nif you’re a truly gifted actor and you’ve done your homework. Be sure to work with \nyour Storyteller on this concept well in advance of introducing it into your chronicle: \nyou’re essentially intending to play acharacter who is in turn playing a character, and \nthat can get tricky (not to mention confusing). \nWhile it’s your task to agitate quietly on behalf of your comrades and to be their \nsecret weapon, you can only push those who want to maintain the status quo so far, \nlest you betray your sympathies. On the surface you’re a firm believer in the value of \nthe Camarilla sect, its Traditions and its conventions, but privately you’re always on \nthe lookout for a new opportunity to cut the anarchs some needed slack. However, \nunless you want to risk blowing your cover, all your efforts to make a difference on \nbehalf of the anarchs should be subtle. If you’re not moderate and temperate in your \nadvocacy for changes within the domain or sect, all your work may be undone. \nEventually, you’ll probably get caught. The reality of the live-action environ- \nment is that no secret stays hidden for very long - \nand why should it, since the \nexposure of secrets is one of the most dramatic elements of the game? You should \nexpect and prepare for the night when somebody tumbles to your charade. Know the \nrisks when you choose to play this type of character. Your character should know the \nrisks as well: if she’s caught, she can do tremendous damage to the local anarchs \nbecause of the specialized knowledge she carries in her head - \nknowledge that can \nbe extracted through a variety of different methods, few of them pleasant. You can \nTHHE \nANARCH GJIDE \n136 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nreduce the dangers to your comrades through the simple expedient of not being told \nanything that’s not critical to your mission; even so you’ll probably be able to divulge \nat least some of the names and faces of local anarchs and their sympathizers. Be careful \nwhat you allow yourself to know about your fellows, for your own sake as well as theirs. \nIf your cell has the means to create some mental safeguards in your head through \ncareful use of Dominate, that could help you fend off initial assaults on your memories, \nat least long enough for a rescue party to arrive. But if you’re exposed, chanoes are \nyou’ll eventually be dragged in front of a Kindred who’s a lot older and stronger than \nyou are, and your secrets will be dragged out of you. \nSo why undertake this mission if the risks are so high? For one thing, it can be \na lot of fun despite the danger. The chameleon offers a lot of solid roleplaying \nopportunities for anarch characters, particularly those who intend to be around long \nenough to (hopefully) see their labors bear fruit. Your character might also do it for \nthe sheer thrill - \nafter all, what could be more exciting than subverting the system \nfrom within by hiding right under your enemy’s nose? Knowing that you’re putting \none over on the enemy can be a tremendous rush. Or maybe you’re convinced that \nonly by becoming a mole and working to better the anarchs’ lot from within the \nCamarilla can you accomplish something important. \nRegardless of your motivation, remember to be clear about your role: You’re a full- \nfledged and committed member of the Anarch Movement who is willing to jeopardize \nyour reputation, holdings and safety to further the aims of the Cause. Your assignment \nis to convince everyone that you are a respected and respectable member of the status \nquo, preferably gaining a place within the very power structure that you’re trying to \nalter. You’ll probably have to become that individual in order to project a believable \npersona, so be prepared to suffer from periods of doubt and uncertainty, perhaps even \nmoments of conflicting loyalties - but relish these opportunities for dramatic \ntoleplaying! Aim for domain stations such as primogen or whip, perhaps even sheriff \nor deputy - \nyou’ll be able to do more good in such roles than as a Keeper of Elysium \nor seneschal, because you’ll deal more directly and intimately with other Kindred on \na night-to-night basis. All the more opportunities to push for change, not to mention \nthat such posts generally don’t attract the same attention as the higher-ups. \nWhat It Takes: Because you’ll have to fool everybody all the time, load up on \nTraits that will help you dissemble convincingly: Expression, Performance and \nSubterfuge will be your best friends among the Abilities. Don’t skimp on the Emj>athy \neither, if you hope to monitor how believable your targets find your performance. Be \nsure your Social Traits are numerous and diverse enough to see you through in your \nnightly game of quiet warfare: when the seneschal is questioning you carefully about \nyour political leanings is the wrong time to run out of Traits. Stocking up on \nWillpower is almost never a bad idea, both to keep your Traits up and help resist the \npowers that fly in the social setting in which you’ll be immersed. Needless to say, \nPresence and Dominate are both valuable for helping win over allies and fix slips in \nyour cover, while Obfuscate and Obtenebration are vital for situations requiring \ngenuine stealth. Auspex is also vital in ferreting out answers even clever lies can’t \nexpose, and so some study of it is recommended to learn such buried secrets. \nCHAPTER FOUR RADICAL THINKING \nt 37 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nGAMES \nANARCHISTS \nPLAY \nUnless you’re playing in an all-anarch chronicle, do not attempt to engage in any \nfavorite anarch amusements where the Kindred can observe you. If you have to ask \nwhy you shouldn’t play a game of “Nines” in the vacant lot behind the art museum \nwhile the elders are enjoying the pleasures of the Elysium, we can only advise you to \nhave your next character firmly in mind and ready to play. But when you’re hanging \nwith your revolutionary buddies, it’s sometimes fun to cut loose and enjoy a few hours \nof respite from the grim and deadly world of undead political activism. \nBear Baiting - \nA time-honored pastime among anarchs young and old, this is \none of the few games anarchs play in full view of other Kindred. In fact, it’s played \nin the Elysium. The rules are simple: Without violating the letter of the law in \nElysium, an anarch tries to goad, taunt or debate an elder into an embarrassing \noutburst (or frenzy, if the anarch thinks he can take the pounding). Needless to say, \nthis kind of recreation is incredibly dangerous, and can have repercussions that reach \nfar beyond the immediate problem of making an enemy out of the target elder. \nLA. Rouktte - \nTwo anarchs stand facing one another and smash each other \nwith a baseball bat, police baton, section of rebar or their fists until one of them gives \nup or falls into torpor. Although proponents of L.A. Roulette insist that it’s a kind \nof modern duel of honor, many dismiss it as a waste of time and good baseball bats. \nPin the Tail on the Prince -Exactly what it sounds like, this variation on the mortal \nchild’s party game features a prince rather than a donkey. Or rather it features an \nunfortunate anarch who represents the prince (some go so far as to dress him in clothes \nthat mimic the local praxis holder). In this version of the game, the target is blindfolded \nand tries to escape the players, all of whom are attempting to attach a prop tail to his \nperson, usually with a suitably sharp object such as a hunting knife or railroad spike. \nObviously, this game often results in hurt feelings among those who play it. \nNines - \nThis pastime is suitable for play in deserted quarries, abandoned \nfactories and just about any other place distant from the heart of the city. The game \nis similar to paintball, except that its players use real firearms with live ammunition. \nThe exact rules vary from place to place, with the only common denominator being \n“no deliberate head shots.” Smart anarchs place lookouts nearby to warn them of \napproaching cops, innocent bystanders and furious sheriffs. A more deadly variation \nof this game, “Sixty-Nines,” pits the anarchs against a target or targets who are \nunaware they are playing a game. Final Death is rarely incurred during such games, \nat least for the anarchs, though serious injuries are understandably fairly common. \nShould the targets manage to fight their way out, the anarchs let them in on the \n“joke” and go off on their merry way, leaving their shattered and bewildered dupes \nto wonder exactly what happened to them. \nNote: Be mindful of the cardinal rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre. They always \napply, even if your character is participating in a high-speed game of neonate tag \nthrough a crowded park. Fun as they may be when handled correctly, some of these \ngames may be inappropriate for certain players, troupes or even venues, so use \ncommon sense and consult the Storyteller when in doubt about whether or not a \nparticular game is appropriate. \ne\ni\nTHL ANARCH \nGUIDE \n138 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHA~ER \nFOUR: RADICAL THINKING \n139 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDo not needlessly endanger your lives.. . until \n- \nDwight Eisenhower \nI give you the signal. \nSTORYTELLING \nANARCH \nCHRONICLES \nWhether you’re integrating anarch characters into your existing Chronicle or \nestablishing a new, all-anarch tale, this chapter provides you with the tools and \ninformation you need to create lasting and memorable stories for anarch char.xters. \nGFTTING \nSTARTFD \nAnarchs do not exist in avacuum. If they did, their unlives (and your game) would \nbe incredibly dull. The defining characteristic of the anarch existence is struggle. The \nrevolutionaries of the Anarch Movement must continually be struggling for or against \nsomething, whether the decrees of an oppressive prince or the Sabbat’s hypoc:risy in \ndealing with its younger Brothers and Sisters. Your principle task as the Storyteller is \nto make sure that any and all anarch characters in your troupe have something with \nwhich they can match wits or cross swords. Sounds easy, right? Well, in some ways, it \nis that simple. But there are a few things you should probably think about before tossing \na few of the prince’s bullyboys into the path of the oncoming anarch characters. \nKNOW \nYOURPLAYERS \nWhat do your players want out of the anarch character experience? Presumably \nthe players who want to portray anarch personas have approached you about it, or vice \nversa. Either way, it should be obvious that you won’t railroad them into plots and \ne \nI \nCHAPTER \nFix: So You WAW A REVOLUTON \n141 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nstorylines they don’t care for. You need to know what your players want from the story \nso you can give it to them. Storytelling is largely a service industry, and good Chronicles \nare the result of understanding and cooperation between the Storyteller and the \nplayers. You might not be able to give them everything they want -you have a number \nof other players and the integrity of your Chronicle’s story to consider, after all -but \nyou should at least make an effort to launch anarch-related stories in the right direction. \nAre the players hoping for a tense “Cold War” scenario in which they play cat and \nmouse against the prince and primogen through the halls of Elysium? Or maybe a \nnightly running fight for survival against the unrelenting scourge? How about a fast- \npaced action adventure yarn that pits them against a ductus and her loyal packmates? \nTalk to your anarch players before they create their characters: It’s best to figure \nout what your players’ preferences are before their characters actually enter play. This \nis particularly important when incorporating anarchs into your existing Chronicle. \nPreparing a coterie of armed revolutionaries dedicated to the violent overthrow of \nthe Camarilla and then dropping them into your subtle Elysium-based game of \npolitical intrigue is a sure ticket to catastrophe. Then again, so is forming a cadre of \ndedicated non-violent proselytizers and tossing them into the midst of your free-for- \nall Sabbat pack game. Encourage anarch concepts that complement your story if you \nwant to avoid an immediate surge of player disapproval. \nKNOW \nYOURSELF \nThis chapter presumes that you have some experience as a Storyteller for Laws \nof the Night games. If you’re relatively new to the Storytelling gig, it’s important to \nrealize now that this is one of the hardest roles in the game. Think it’s tough playing \nthe Keeper of Elysium when the anarchs are tossing grenades into the art museum? \nThat’s peanuts to the stress that Storytellers can expect in setting up and running just \none game session for 30 players! In short, be sure you have the time and energy \navailable to take on this responsibility. If you’re short on either one, you’ll have to \nreadjust your schedule, hand the Storytelling reins over to somebody else or do what \nmost beleaguered Storytellers do: seek Narrator help. \nTHF BUILDING \nBLOCKS \nOn the surface, anarch characters appear to want the very same things all \nKindred want: security, comfort and power. The difference between the two camps \nis that the anarchs are quite willing to work outside socially accepted channels to get \nwhat they want. In fact, more often than not they’re forced to do so. This critical \ndifference underscores and informs the key components of your anarch stories. \n~ F T T I N G  \nWhen introducing anarchs into an established game, it’s a sure bet that the \nincoming anarch characters will interact and maybe clash with the existing charac- \nters. Whether your setting is a single city or an entire country, it’s a good idea to \nidentify at least one area within the setting that the anarchs can use as a relatively \nsafe haven. This could be a single building, a city block, a neighborhood within a \nlarger city or a whole town if your setting is large enough and your anarchs are \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n142 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsufficiently numerous. Without a base of operations, the anarchs won’t last long no \nmatter what the story is about. Then take a look at the mortal institutions that are \nimportant to your setting, and get ready to monitor any Background Traits tkat the \nanarch characters might utilize to make connections in these areas. Think about how \nthe existing characters are likely to react when they become aware of the presence \nof anarchs, and how that might affect your setting. Is the prince likely to un11,mber \nhis Police and Underworld Influences to strike at the revolutionaries? Does the scourge \nrely on his Allies to help him patrol the barrens where the anarchs are hiding out? \nAre the anarchs likely to stake out various physical locations in the city- museums, \noffice buildings, havens and so on - \nwhere the elders and their lackeys might be \nspending time? Being prepared for these eventualities will help you integrate the \nanarch characters into your Chronicle more smoothly and also enable you to make \nthe most of your setting’s potential. \nDetermine how the indigenous vampire population will react to the anarchs, and \nhow you’ll weave their attitudes and actions into your story. The Camarilla city might \nseem ready to tolerate the presence of anarchs, but individual Kindred will attempt \neither to oppose the anarchs or ensnare them in subtle political schemes. The Sabbat- \nheld city is an exceedingly dangerous setting even for a Chronicle in which all the \nplayers are portraying anarchs: The Cainites won’t be tolerant of revolutionaries in \ntheir midst, and few packs will stop to argue philosophy or doctrine before launching \ndirect attacks. Settings that include conflict between vampires of both sects, with the \nanarchs playing the wild card in the struggle between the two, can make for very rich \nand exciting stories. A story set in a Camarilla-held city plagued by scouting Sabbat \npacks that are the leading edge of an impending siege, or inside territory dominated by \nthe Sword of Caine that’s suffering from Ivory Tower incursions, can help you illustrate \nthe anarchs’ greater importance in the grand scheme of things. \nSCALE \nScale for anarch stories comes into play primarily as the arbiter of how many \nanarch characters you’re willing to allow in the game. Chronicles built around the \nCamarilla can often sustain a sizable number of anarch characters, since the Ivory \nTower is the traditional antagonist in stories featuring anarchs yet does not always have \na kill-on-sight order for them either. Many anarchs operate routinely (if not conifort- \nably) within the Camarilla, working toward changing its hidebound attitude; and \noppressive social structure, and the Camarilla Kindred often tolerate these inconve- \nnient residents. Depending on how openly rebellious the anarch characters are, a good \nrule of thumb is one anarch character for every five Kindred. This number may grow \nas the anarchs recruit disgruntled neonates to their cause, or shrink as the elders work \ndirectly against the revolutionaries, but it provides a working baseline. If your \nCamarilla story focuses on social and political intrigue, count on the anarchs’ numbers \nto shrink rapidly if they show signs of making open war on the Kindred and their assets. \nIn stories centered on the Sabbat, scale is often the deciding factor in determin- \ning how long the anarch characters will survive. Unlife for anarchs in a \nSabbat-dominated town is usually a nightly struggle for existence, and hopes for \nCHA~ER \nFIVE: So You WAN A REVOLUTION \n143 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncarrying out any revolutionary agendas are slim. Scale can get tricky in these stories, \nbecause the anarchs have little choice other than to violently oppose the Sabbat if \nthey hope to stay alive. The right number of anarchs for Sabbat-centric stories varies \ndepending on the style of the Chronicle. If the story includes a significant amount \nof political intrigue between rival powers, you could probably start with the same \nratio as for Camarilla-centric stories (51). But in general, entire cities dominated by \nthe Sword of Caine can support a small number of experienced and tough, or a larger \nnumber of desperate or clever, anarch characters. Suppose you’re telling the story of \ntwo rival Sabbat packs engaged in a street-level battle against the local Camarilla: \nHow many anarch characters could you safely drop into the middle of this conflict? \nToo few and the Sabbat will simply destroy them out of hand: too many and they’ll \nlikely change the entire nature of the Chronicle. You want enough anarchs to present \nthe rival packs with options other than destroying the anarchs right away, but not so \nmany that the Sabbat flee the city because they suddenly feel outnumbered. \nFor all-anarch Chronicles, scale takes on a completely different meaning. All or \nnearly all of the players will be portraying anarch characters, so you don’t need to \nworry about total numbers. But you’ll need to take into consideration how many \nmembers of the various factions within the Anarch Movement you’re going to \ninclude. You’ll want to encourage a majority of idealist character concepts among the \nanarchs if your story features lots of social maneuvering or political intrigue, a \npreponderance of fiery revolutionaries if you anticipate a more action-oriented yarn, \nand a healthy balance of both for a Chronicle that shifts focus between the two \nextremes. After all, if all your players are anarchs, unless you want all your threats to \nbe external and Storyteller-controlled, you’re going to need some seeds of personal \nrivalry between the players themselves. \nScope \nDeath to the prince! Down with the Ivory Tower! Long live the Anarch Free \nState of West Trenton! Scope is what’s at stake in your story: It’s the range of \npossibility for character action. What do the anarchs in your Chronicle hope to \naccomplish?Are they trying to usher the winds of change into their home city, or are \nthey just trying to hang onto their scrap of turf out in the barrens? Probably the most \nimportant consideration in determining the scope of your story is who is involved in \nthe central conflict. \nBe careful in setting the scope for games in which other players are playing the \nanarchs’ mainopposition, be they Kindred or Cainite. All the anarch characters in your \nstory might have the long-term goal of overthrowing the prince throughviolent means, \nand then turning their home city into a haven for the Anarch Movement. But is this \ngoal compatible with your story’s larger direction? Consider the consequences should \nthe anarchs actually succeed in wresting control of the city from the prince and \nprimogen through violent means. Will the other players - \nthose whose characters are \nthe hated oppressors -balk at the sudden shift in the game’s direction and focus? \nYou might be tempted to allow the player characters to accomplish whatever they \ncan legitimately get away with in the game. If the prince and primogen fail to detect \nthe anarchs’ explosive device under the Elysium and perish in a blaze of fiery death, who \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n144 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncan blame the anarchs for then taking over the city? But believe it or not, this kind of \nlaissez-faire approach to scope can quickly land your game in big trouble. Those who \nsigned on for a Camarilla or Sabbat Chronicle might be left feeling a bit peeved if‘ their \ncharacters are suddenly unwelcome or unplayable en masse due to an anarch-backed \nuprising. And the reverse is also true: continually thwarting the anarchs’ attempt to \nachieve their goals through Storyteller fiat only produces dissatisfied anarch players. \nThat’s not to say that the anarch characters shouldn’t be allowed to puraue or \naccomplish goals. But their goals and their methods of pursuit should fit the larger \nstory you’re trying to tell. Anarch characters dropped into sect-oriented games \nshould almost always have more limited goals that don’t involve the utter destruction \nof all the other player characters. Let them try to steal assets from the local Cainites \nin order to up their resources in preparation for a move to a safer and more permanent \nhome, or combat the Harpy’s attempts to reinforce the social status quo by intriguing \namong Kindred movers and shakers. Always watch out for anarchs whose only goals \nhinge on victory through elimination of the other characters: Even in the best hands, \nsuch characters can quickly sow bitterness and bad feelings throughout the Chronicle. \nPLOT \nThe plot is the sequence of events that moves your story forward from game to \ngame. Most plots are a combination of Storyteller-created events and interactions \nbetween player characters: The one affects and informs the other, creating a story \nthat’s the result of cooperative activity between you and your players. Good plots \nattract and hold the players’ interests: bad plots send the players fleeing for the \ncorners, outside the game site or into the next county. Knowing your player:; and \nunderstanding their characters’ ambitions and goals will help you devise plots that \nare fun and memorable for all the participants, including yourself. \nYou’ll find ideas for anarch stories all around you, in books, movies, television \nprograms and the evening news. The struggle for freedom is a popular theme in many \ncultural expressions, and you should have no shortage of fictional and real-world \ninspirations. Look to the civil rights movement of the mid-to-late 20th century for \nplot ideas that focus on the struggle for equality. Check out some library books atbout \nthe French Revolution or the War for American Independence for story seeds that \nfeature violent uprisings against feudal societies - \nfertile ground for traditional \nanarch vs. Camarilla stories. \nYour best bet in devising anarch-related plots and subplots is to answer the question, \n“What do the anarchs want?” Identifying the anarch characters’ goals will help you decide \nhow to focus your story’s direction. When you’re ready to sketch out the plots that will \ninvolve the anarch characters, review the goals that your players have established and use \nthese as the foundations of your story arcs. You’ll find that working this out also helps you \ndecide how best to introduce the anarch characters into existing Chronicles. \nPLOT \nSTRUCTURES \nWe the Kindred: Political Reform Plots \nExploring the revolutionary heart of the Anarch Movement means exploring \nvarious socio-political philosophies and how they work (or don’t work) among the \nCHAPTER \nFIVE: So You Wm A REVOLUTION \n145 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nunliving. Typically, the hard-core revolutionaries are nomadic, sometimes by choice \nbut usually by necessity: Their brand of zealotry tends to ensure that any welcome \nthey receive in a Camarilla city wears thin quickly. Sometimes political-minded \nanarchs are so vocal and adamant in their views that they can’t interact effectively \nwith the Kindred, unless the local prince is either tolerant or ineffective. Plots that \nfocus on die-hard anarch rebels often work best in one of two sets of circumstances: \nThe anarchs are Narrator characters working together as a small nomadic cell, or the \nrevolutionaries are just one of several different types of anarchs in an all-anarch story. \nRevolutionary plots require direct conflict between opposing points of view. The \nbattleground can be the halls of Elysium or the deserted streets of the barrens, but \nregardless of the venue the lines between the clashing philosophies should be clearly \ndrawn. Paint the Camarilla oppression (or Sabbat fanaticism) with broad strokes, so \nthat it contrasts visibly with the reforms the anarchs are pursuing. Violence is not \nuncommon in revolutionary plots, as the more radical anarchs support organized \ncampaigns against the Camarilla in the hope of displacing the Ivory Tower’s grip on \nlocal resources. This kind of grass-roots activism works best, again, if the anarchs are \nNarrator characters - \nnot because the anarchs in these plots are necessarily antago- \nnists, but because you want to be certain that the revolutionaries don’t try to wantonly \ndestroy everyone who opposes them. To present the anarchs as a credible threat and \ngive them a decent chance of survival in the early days of the plot, consider arranging \nfor the radicals to hole up in a location that’s well suited to their agenda, such as a college \ncampus or union-controlled factory. There the characters can gain access to resources, \nincluding mortal followers, which can support and prolong their cause without \nstraining the story’s credibility from the beginning. \nJustice for All: Social Reform Plots \nPerhaps the most common source of the dissatisfaction and desperation that leads to \nthe creation of anarchs is the social environment in which they are expected to survive. The \nCamarilla relies on a neo-feudal social structure to keep the princes (and, more importantly, \nthe elders) at the top of the heap. Understandably, this is stultifying to Kindred who just a \nfew short years ago were enjoying the unprecedented social and personal freedoms of the \n21st century, and many of them find that they simply can’t or won’t put up with that kind \nof crap. It’s bad enough that they’ve been turned into unliving, blood-drding monsters, \nbut they’ve also got to smile and lick the boots of even more terrible monsters? The cliche \n“anarchs screaming at theprince”scenari0 is what most often comes to mind when thinking \nabout social advancement. But a Chronicle built around social and cultural conflicts can \nbe a rich roleplaying environment for your players. \nAnarchs are much closer to their mortal roots than most elders and ancillae, so \nthey’re capable of keeping up with current mortal trends and fashions. Maybe the \nanarch characters open their own club, gallery or rave, making it more appealing than \nwhat the Kindred can make available by tapping into popular counter-culture music, \nlanguage, fashions and dkcor. Suddenly the established Kindred aren’t the trendsetters \namong the mortal population of the city: That distinction goes now to the anarchs. \nStatus seekers among the Kindred must either submit to the anarchs’ superiority in \nthe social arena or compete with them. Which do you think they’re going to do? \nt\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \nI46 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-+ \ni \nC \nFrom here the story might branch in several different directions. The Kindred \ncould try to move directly against the source of their embarrassment by attacking \nproperties and even people with which the anarchs are associated: The same is true \nfor the anarchs. The Kindred could attempt to fight back using their accumulated \nconnections to the mortal world, such as their Influences, forcing the anarchs to \nexpend their (probably much less extensive) resources to block the Kindred’s \ngambits. The anarchs may find themselves waging a guerrilla war without guns in \norder to hold on to what they’ve got, scrambling to stay ahead of the trend curve by \nscouting continuously for new acts and supporting their own avenues of success. Or \nthey might resort to violence out of frustration: Turning the Malkavian whip’s latest \nrave into a free-for-all bar brawl could certainly generate some negative press. \nIt’s important to remember that stories of this stripe are intended to be about \nanarchs, not about neonates who just want to appropriate the goodies that belong to \ntheir elders, or who like to hang out and jam to heavy metal music together. Anarchs \nhave concerns that are tied to the emerging social scene, and that includes the black \nmarket for firearms, the illicit drug trade and peddling political influence. Angry \nneonates leaping for the brass ring aren’t necessarily anarchs, and vice versa. \nShare the Wealth: Economic Advancement Plots \nSome anarchs claim to be above the needs of filthy lucre, but not all of them share \nthis sentiment. And is it really so surprising that anarchs might want to have their crack \nat enjoying the financial benefits of unlife? Eonomic reform plots in your Chronicle \nmight focus on anarchs who start up their own companies, maybe in the high-tech or \ntechnical communications fields. The key here is to give the anarchs a chance to compete \nin new ways with the elders’ more traditional business interests. Is your Chronicle set in \nan area that’s dominated by a single industry? If so, chances are that some of the most \npowerful and influential characters in your game have ties to that industry. If the anarch \ncharacters can identify these holdings, they can attack them, directly or indirectly. Or the \nanarchs could try to muscle in on the more mundane businesses controlled by the \nKindred, such as clothing boutiques, art galleries and trendy nightclubs. Who knows - \nwith the mistakes of the past behind them, the anarch-run companies might prove \nsuccessful where the over-hyped firms of the 1990s failed. \nNo Justice, No Peace: Combat Plots \nIt’s sometimes true that players choose anarchs because they want to beat on \nthings until they break. If this is what your players really want, you have a \nresponsibility to give it to them, so long as it doesn’t do the Chronicle as a whole a \ngrave disservice. But running combat plots doesn’t mean every game must be a tllood- \ndrenched, all-out melee to the death (or hours spent in tests and combat time). With \na little preparation, you can turn a combat plot into a memorable and challenging \nroleplaying experience for your players. \nRather than throwing a bunch of random enemies at your players - \nthe scourge \nthis week, shovelhead packs the next, etc. -plan out the individual battles so that \nthe participants, objectives and stakes are clear for both sides. Where do the anarchs \nthink they’re going to run into trouble? Maybe they’re planning a raid on a factory \nowned by the seneschal, intending to damage his ability to generate cash flow. Elefore \nGAPTER \nFIK So You WAN A RLVOLUTION \n147 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe actual raid can take place, the anarchs must reconnoiter the target location and \nattempt to learn about its defenses, security and weak points. Determine before the \nbattle what types of obstacles and hazards the anarchs will encounter, both mundane \nand supernatural, and note any key Narrator characters that may enter the fray on \neither side and the capabilities they’ll bring to the fight. Following that, jot down \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n148 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsome thoughts about what might happen should the anarchs fail in their mission - \nor more importantly, the long-term consequences if they succeed. If your players balk \nat doing “busy work” because they just want to get down to throwingpunches, remind \nthem that battles are usually very fast, confusing encounters, and that victory \ngenerally goes to the side that did its homework on the enemy. \nThe same holds true when antagonists come to call. Contrary to the belief of \ncertain players, most vampires and other Supernatural creatures do not automatically \nfight to the death: Life and unlife are too precious to throw away merely to prove a point. \nThe enemy should have objectives -drive off the invaders, kill an important fgure, \nrescue a hostage, capture a prisoner, etc. - \nand tactics that support them. An enemy \ntrying to retake his lost turf fights differently than the foe whose main goal is to provide \na diversion for the real assault that is coming later. It is also a common mistake that \nmany enemies (supernatural and otherwise) fail to use anything but the most obvious \nand direct means of attacking their foes, in contrast to the nuanced Discipline use and \npainstaking mundane preparations employed by the players. Most often this happens \nwhen Storytellers make up enemies on the fly and don’t give them any thought beyond \nthe immediate conflict. Your enemies often have access to supernatural powers and \nresources too - \nmake sure they use them to their full advantage! \nThe key to running good combat plots is to make the antagonists believable. \nDon’t just throw wave after wave of faceless deputies or anonymous Sabbat packs at \nthe anarchs: Each and every opponent should be as motivated and goal-oriented as \nthe anarchs themselves. Your players shouldn’t be sitting around the local anarch \nhangout waiting for the next antagonist to show up for a slugfest; they should be \ndealing with enemies who use the same tactics the anarchs are employing, such as \nscouting missions, infiltration attempts, strikes against vital resources, exploitation \nof weaknesses and so on. When convinced that they’re up against a thinking foe, the \ncharacters will feel like they’re at war, and that their victory is anything but \nguaranteed - \nand that is what gives good combat its edge. \nWarring In the Margins: AnarcheIndependent Conflicts \nThough it is less likely than all-out conflict with the sects, never forget that the \nindependent clans have agendas of their own. That means anarchs can quickly \nbecome competition if they try to claim lands or influence the independents consider \nvaluable. While these outsiders may not be able to claim the sheer depth of mundane \nresources that the sects can (though the Giovanni can come close if sufficiently \nroused), they are quite adept within their own niche and are typically much better \nversed at how to defend it from outsiders as well. More than one group of anarchs has \nmoved into a small town or city neighborhood they thought was free, just because it \nhad no sect presence, only to find they’ve intruded on the territory of an independent \nclan and are being targeted for retaliation accordingly. \nWhen plotting these conflicts, then, it is generally best to look at them as akin \nto guerrilla warfare campaigns: Unless the clan in question feels it has sufficient \nstrength to banish or destroy the anarchs outright, it must force them out through \nmore indirect ways. It also means that these clans will not pick fights they do nor feel \nthey can win, but when they do act, they will do so with precision, having carefully \nCHAPTER \nFa: So You WAN A REVOLUTION \n1 49 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nweighed all the relevant factors in advance. Most will make extensive use of mortal \ncontacts, influence and favors to pressure the local revolutionaries, as well as create \na broader field of targets and intermediaries the anarchs must work through to trace \nthings back to them. Of course, should the clan members feel the need to become \npersonally involved, things only get worse. Selective assassinations performed by \nskilled Assamites, vicious rumors spread by Setite manipulators, ruthless financial \nmaneuvering by Giovanni corporate officers or destructive cons pulled by canny \nRavnos can all make the anarchs’ unlives unbearable in short order. Even the \nGangrel, while often more sympathetic than the others to the anarch cause, do not \nautomatically welcome the presence of revolutionaries in their territory, and can use \ntheir mastery of animals to plague the anarchs with any number of persistent pest \nproblems. And should the Outlander have Lupine allies.. . \nThe Recruiting Ground: Sabbat-Anarch Plots \nIntroducing anarch characters into a Sabbat Chronicle is usually more difficult \nthan bringing the same characters into a Chronicle that focuses on the Camarilla. \nWhile Camarilla elders dislike the revolutionary screeds spouted by their young \ndissidents, they tolerate it a surprising amount of the time. Sabbat Cainites, on the \nother hand, don’t waste time trying to squelch dissent by bringing social or economic \npressure to bear: They’re much more likely to destroy the little crybabies outright. A \ncommon misconception among newly minted anarchs is that the Sabbat is a source \nof potential allies and even comrades in the fight against Camarilla oppression. \nThese newcomers don’t realize that for the Sabbat, “fight” means an all-out war to \nextinguish the enemy, not reform its political institutions! Sabbat Cainites already \nhave equality, as far as they are concerned, so why bother fighting for a cause that’s \nalready won? And the Sabbat’s ideology is aimed at something far more threatening \nthan the petty politics of the Camarilla: the enemy sect’s Antediluvian masters. \nThreats to egalitarianism seem like pretty small potatoes compared to the danger of \nbeing messily devoured by some ravening, millennia-old monster. So there’s not \nmuch chance of the average anarch cell recruiting successfully from established \nSabbat packs they encounter. \nWith that in mind, the Sabbat makes a good antagonist for the all-anarch \nChronicle (see below). Confrontations with the Sword of Caine can be effective \ncontrasts to the more sophisticated conflicts against the Camarilla. Spring the Sabbat \non the anarchs just as the characters are becoming complacent in their struggle against \nthe local court, and watch the tone of the story change quickly. Have a few Sabbat \nvampires call on the anarchs and issue an ultimatum: either join up with us and help \nus take out the local Licks, or we’ll stake you out for the sun too. The anarchs might \ndecide to comply, only to discover that unlife as a Sabbat ally may be as oppressed and \nunfair as being a Camarilla enemy. And what happens if the Sabbat prevails? The \nanarchs may find themselves members of a club that they really don’t want to belong \nto. The anarchs could also decide to shelve their grievances long enough to help the \nCamarilla drive out the invading Sabbat, but then they run the risk of losing any gains \nthey’ve made. Worse, the prince and his supporters might blame the anarchs for \ndrawing the attention of the Sabbat, and make their unlives more miserable than ever. \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDE \n150 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nStorytellers frequently fret that storylines centered around the conflict between \nanarchs and the Sabbat are too one-dimensional, becoming little more than battle after \nbattle. Like most issues dealing with the undead, however, it need only be that \nsimplistic if you want it to. Contrary to popular opinion, the Sabbat does not seek to \nsolve every problem with endless waves of shovelheads or terrorist attacks by the :Black \nHand. It can be quite patient, even seductive when it suits the needs of the sect to \nemploy such methods. The Movement and the Sabbat were born together, after all, and \nespecially once an anarch starts becoming bitter and disillusioned, the promises of the \nSwordofCaine become more and more enticing. For their part, the Sabbat is well aware \nof how easy it is for many anarchs, especially hardliners and others obsessed with \nvictory, to start looking at the sect’s resources and organization and wonder what: they \nmight be able to do with such assets at their disposal. From there, it’s just a few small \nsteps to forging a formal alliance, and then maybe a conversion or two.. .. \nTo that end, if you’re looking for an innovative approach to including the Sword \nof Caine in your Chronicle, resist the temptation to have the Sabbat come asff as \nheavy-handed and thuggish. While they’re perfectly capable of backing up th.reats \nthey make, if they can win converts without a battle, so much the better. After all, \nanarchs are already one step removed from the Camarilla - \nthis makes them that \nmuch more susceptible to the right promises and propaganda, especially if it’s voiced \nby a charismatic Sabbat member who isn’t the raving fanatic the anarchs will expect. \nPatience is definitely required to wait out their initial distrust, and any kind of \nviolence against the anarchs by the Sabbat will ruin it utterly, but once that: first \nbarrier is surpassed things become a lot easier for the recruiter. Many things the \nanarchs feel they need-numbers, \ntraining, resources, etc. -can be provided by the \nSabbat, and their ideals aren’t too terribly different, especially when presented 1sy an \neloquent speaker. Even those anarchs who remain unconvinced should still feel a \ndefinite conflict over what they have heard. \nOf course, if you still wish to run the Sabbat as nightmarish villains in your game, \nby all means go ahead. It is recommended, however, that you augment their physical \nferocity by showcasing their twisted beliefs and practices as well. This not only elevates \nthem beyond the level of mindless antagonists in the eyes of the players, but also adds \nto their horrific effect and further underscores that there but for the grace of Caine go \nthe anarchs themselves. The important thing to remember when running storylines \npitting the anarchs and the Sabbat against each other is that the Sabbat can serve as \na hideous reflection of what the anarchs themselves might become, should they ;illow \ntheir crusade to devour their humanity and become their single all-consuming passion. \nTHF ALL-ANARCH \nCHRONICLF \nSo you want to dispense with the larger sects altogether and tell a story in which all \nor most of the characters are anarchs! Anarch-only Chronicles generally work best with \narelatively smallnumberofplayers: Betweensix and adozenisoptimal. In thissort oftale, \nthe details of the actual struggle for freedom will probably take a back seat to the \nrelationships between the characters. How the anarchs relate to and interact with one \nanother will be the principle source of the conflict and drama necessary to fuel the story. \nCHAFIR FNE: So You WANI A REVOL~KION \n151 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Storytelling advice in this chapter covers this type of Chronicle, too, but \nthere are a few additional considerations to think about before you get started. For \nexample, the character roles deserve special attention. Presumably all these anarchs \nhave at least a nominal leader, and that individual needs to be portrayed by \nsomebody. The other characters will naturally take their cue from the baron, pack \nleader or other authority figure, so consider whether you want to allow these \nleadership roles to develop organically during the course of the game, or if it’s safer \nto cast them and allow any changes to occur naturally as the story proceeds. Next \nyou’ll want to determine exactly whom or what the anarchs are opposing. Are they \nfighting to bring change to a Camarilla-held city that’s recently suffered a mauling \nat the hands of a Sabbat siege? Maybe they’ve elected to make contact with raw \nSabbat recruits who are members of a semi-nomadic pack. The question of loyalty \ncould become key to the story, especially if any of the characters are older anarchs \nwho begin to feel the pull of age and complacency wearing down their will to \ncontinue fighting the good fight. \nThe uniquely anarch option for this type of Chronicle is the nomadic pack, and \nit’s particularly well suited to small troupes (six or less players is a good rule of thumb \nfor a nomadic story). As the anarchs travel from city to city in the name of the Cause, \nthey face perils not only from the Camarilla and the Sabbat, but also from marauding \nLupines, curious mortals, motorcycle-riding witch-hunters and heaven knows what \nother threats. This is a story about the desperation and determination of a tightly knit \ngroup of fellow travelers. This type of Chronicle should be undertaken only by groups \nof players who are already comfortable with one another, because the actions of one \ncharacter can dramatically affect all the others. \nRunning nomadic anarch Chronicles can require a lot of additional work from the \nStoryteller. Every time the characters pack up and set out for a new destination, they \nmust secure shelter, locate sustenance, disguise their identities, dodge pursuers, deal \nwith authorities both mundane and supernatural and keep an eye out for Lupines. Some \nof these activities don’t make for especially interesting game sessions, so you could \nrelegate them to the downtime and narrate them via email, telephone or over coffee. \nAlternately, you could devote a portion of each game session to taking care of the more \nmundane necessities of the nomadic unlifestyle, devising feeding and pursuit tests that \nhelp you reflect all the night-to-night dangers and difficulties facing the anarch road \nwarriors. This type of Chronicle tends to be supporting-cast-heavy, because you’ll need \nto portray the different individuals with whom the players come into contact at stops \nalong their journey. Maybe you have a few friends who weren’t able to commit to a \nregular game schedule but still want to be involved as time permits. No problem! These \nfolks are the perfect choice to help you fill in the roles of the Sabbat packs, sheriffs and \nvampire hunters that your characters are bound to run into. \nTHE FNFMY \nWITHIN \nAnarch characters don’t spend all their time scheming to overthrow the prince \nor planting bombs under cars. The same degree of variety that makes anarchs \ninteresting and versatile characters also guarantees that internal struggles will erupt \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n152 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwithin cells and packs. As a consequence, anarchs sometimes spend more time \nfighting one another than their opponents, a fact you should be quick to capitalize \non to keep the Movement fresh and edgy in the minds of your players. \nIf your Chronicle is focused on either of the two larger sects, any internal \nconflicts between anarch characters may spell their doom. Sometimes the seeds of \nthese disagreements are planted by wily Kindred out to pit one anarch against \nanother, while other times they are the natural result of the clashing Natures of two \ncharacters with differing visions of the road to victory against the sects. Or simple \nfrustration at their lack of progress may lead them to turn against one another. \nProvided the source of the conflict is rooted in characters and the story, it’s usually \nsafe to let it ride. Revolutions that fail, and the pattern of their failures, can make for \nvery compelling stories, so allow the player characters to determine their fates \nwithout your help. Only when you notice or sense that the anarchs’ internal \nsquabbling might be based on player relations, rather than those of their characters, \nshould you step in and take the reins. \nSome common conflict archetypes for anarch vs. anarch conflicts are as follows: \nGang vs. Gang \nNaturally enough, anarch gangs can and do fight over everything from revolution- \nary ideals to old grudges to business practices to simple turf wars. A gang devoted to \nfreeing mankind from the influence of vampires entirely and creating a separate \nvampire nation, for instance, is bound to grapple with the other gang across town that \nbelieves vampires are the next stage of evolution and are thus allowed to do as they \nplease with humans. Likewise, two gangs that both wish to control the local drug trade \n- \nor historical societies, or political primaries, or what have you - \nare bound to \nexchange some harsh words unless they can hammer out an agreement both sides find \namenable, and fast. While in theory all gangs are part of the Movement and thus should \nat least respect the divergent views of their fellow revolutionaries, in practice when \ndealing with such a passionate and outspoken group as anarchs, conflict of some kind \nis bound to occur. Even if the players are part of a gang that’s trying to keep the peace \nbetween warring packs, there’s still more than enough material for a good Storyteller \nto keep all sides interested for a long time to come. From political maneuvers and \nbackroom intrigue to bloodshed on the streets, the Masquerade is perhaps the on117 limit \non what gangs will do in a war - \nand even that can be stretched or broken if the battle \nbecomes particularly vicious. If anything, the knowledge that sects will almost certainly \nattempt to exploit the conflict among the anarch ranks only makes these wars that \nmuch more brutal, as all sides seek to resolve the conflict as quickly as possible in order \nto prepare for the inevitable threats from without. \nIn this scenario, serious violence is all but destined to erupt as one gang seeks to \nassert its dominance in an indisputable fashion over another. Furthermore, barring \nintervention by the baron or the local council, such conflict is likely to continue until \none gang is either destroyed, run out of town or so thoroughly broken as to be cowed \ninto submission - \nonce the gauntlet is thrown down, all the gangs involved know \nthat only one of them will come out on top. Survival thus means either crushing an \nopponent or siding with the gang that does, and such conflicts frequently cause a \nCHAFER Fa: So You WAN A RLVOUUION \n153 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nflurry of communication between local anarchs as lines are drawn and alliances made \nor broken to keep up with the current climate. Players must not only watch out for \nmembers of gangs with an active rivalry against their own, but also work to make sure \nother gangs in the area aren’t aligning with their rivals. \nSet vs. Set \nIn this tense, tightly wound scenario, the players find themselves part of feuding sets \nin a larger gang. Whether from ideological differences, territory conflicts or personal \nanimosity, they are locked in a struggle to define their own place in the gang and perhaps \npush out or eliminate their rivals in the process. Perhaps one is a younger, up-and-coming \nset that has its eye on territory held by an older set, or maybe a new leader has galvanized \nhis set to challenge for leadership of the gang. Regardless of their composition, the \ndifferent groups find themselves locked in a feud that has no easy resolution. (Or at least \nnone that all parties consider acceptable.) Despite their vows of loyalty, anarchs are still \nas ambitious as any other undead, and when they set their sights on something they are \namazingly persistent. Players find their characters’ loyalties to their sets constantly tested \nas the other side cajoles or threatens them to make them defect to the “winning team,” \nand they must take care to hide their vicious power plays behind a unified front when \nattending gang meetings or facing down mutual enemies. \nUnlike inter-gang warfare, it is much more likely that the different sets must rely \non less direct means in order to achieve their goals - \novert violence not only threatens \nthe gang’s internal stability, but also makes the gang look weak and divided in the eyes \nof its enemies. Sets that try to resolve their conflicts with more than a few simple brawls \nor duels of honor will thus likely find the gang leadership coming down on them \nharshly, possibly even kicking them out if it means saving the reputation of the gang \nas a whole. However, short of that kind of negative attention, all those involved know \nthat anything goes -bribes, blackmail, extortion, theft, rumor-mongering, poaching \nghouls or even the occasional assassination are all par for the course. So long as the sets \ndon’t threaten the gang’s reputation, the leadership may even covertly encourage some \ncompetition between sets in this fashion, particularly if the members are stylish about \ntheir rivalry. Not only does it keep the members alert and at the top of their game, but \nit also distracts them from challenging for leadership themselves. \nFaction vs. Faction \nPerhaps the most basic dispute among anarchs, one that can lead to every other type \nof conflict imaginable, is the conflict that arises when two anarchs of differing political \nimpulses butt heads. While as a rule anarch factions aren’t crystallized into formal political \npartiesorevenrecognizablegroups, thefactremainsthatwhenanihilist andaconstruction- \nist enter the same territory, some sparks are bound to fly. As part of the same set, they may \ncause serious dissension among their fellow members as they seek to win their hen& over \nto their views and discredit their rivals at the same time. As leaders of different sets in the \nsame gang, they can easily cause set feuding as described above, especially if they both hope \nto influence the gang’s leadership into pushing their personal agendas. And as leaders of \ndifferent gangs, mere proximity to such a deep ideological rival has been known to ignite \nconflicts that set whole cities on fire as the two groups attempt to preserve their territories \nand prove their ideological superiority in the most grimly efficient manner possible. \nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n154 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMost ofthe time, it takeslittleeffortbytheStorytellertosetoffsomekindoffactiona1 \nconflict. Players frequently start such feuds themselves in the course of a regular session, \nas their characters compare their views on unlife and the political state of the undead. \nEven if the players themselves are composed of largely amenable impulses, simply placing \na Narrator character or two with radically opposing views in a prominent place among \nthe city’s anarchs is usually enough to ensure that the players eventually come into \nconflict with their philosophical rivals. Such is the nature of politics and opposing \nviewpoints within the Movement -rare indeed are anarchs willing to let others preach \nconflicting ideals without attempting to give some kind of rebuttal. \nCHAPTER \nFIVE: So You Wm A REVOLUTION \n155 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTROUBLESHOOTING \nTHF TROUBLF3OMF \nThis is all the stuff you don’t want to think about, but that you’re going to have \nto deal with as a Storyteller. Fortunately, there are few problems that can’t be solved \nby working with your players and ensuring that everyone knows the main goal of the \nstory is to have fun! \nMindless Violence \nFor Chronicles that focus on the Camarilla or Sabbat, anarch-sponsored \nmindless violence can be the bane of the entire enterprise. Keep an eye out for anarch \ncharacters who routinely send their enemies to the Final Death in the name of \n“revolution,” especially when there’s no real rationale to do so. Similarly, watch for \nplayers whose Kindred or Cainite characters treat all anarchs as nothing more than \nmoving dirt, and who regularly greet anarch Narrator characters with a barrage of \nlethal Discipline powers. Such a player may be indulging in gratuitous in-character \nviolence, particularly if he defends his actions with an explanation like, “but that’s \nwhat my character’s all about.” In-character motivation is clearly important to each \nplayer’s persona, but it can also be a shield players use to hide from the out-of- \ncharacter consequences of their inappropriate actions. Anarch characters don’t exist \nto be killed on a whim any more than Camarilla or Sabbat characters do. In order for \na Chronicle to thrive and endure, all players must make some concession to the fact \nthat the characters must sometimes co-exist in the same setting. \nThe single most difficult problem that any Laws of the Night game faces when \nanarchs enter the picture is the tension between the in-character violence, crudity \nand disruption that such characters can cause, and the out-of-game feelings of the \nplayers involved. In a game that includes characters plotting one another’s injury and \ndeath, it’s easy to understand how feelings can become frayed and hurt when players \nbelieve the negative treatment their characters receive is a reflection of how other \nplayers think and feel about them in an out-of-game context. The line between in- \ngame and out-of-game conflicts should always be distinct, but unfortunately it \nsometimes grows razor thin. This happens frequently when anarch characters come \ninto play, because such characters are often automatically opposed to whichever \nfaction is currently in power. But true anarchs don’t show up without good reason: \nthey should have a purpose in the game, and their role is as valid and conducive to \na good story as that of any other character. Keep the lines of communication open \nbetween your players, and encourage them to give this material its due. It’s worth \nrestating that you’re not obligated to allow any player to have an anarch character \nif he can’t handle the supporting themes and stories. \nWhy Are We Here? \nWhile Camarilla courts may hold Elysium parties or Sabbat packs gather to \nperform various rites, it may seem that anarchs have less in the way of motivation to \ngather in the numbers that other vampires do. In mixed games, this might not be as \nmuch of a problem, since anarchs are unlikely to be a significant majority, and thus \ntheir major gatherings will probably be player-instigated and held as informal side \ngames outside of the regular play sessions. However, in all-anarch or other primarily \nanarch games, it can quickly become a concern. While raves may provide excellent \nTHL ANARCH GUIDE \n156 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nopportunities to showcase a gathering of anarchs, if every game session is supposed \nto be some kind of rave, the players will quickly become bored with a format that is \nsupposed to be edgy and exciting. Instead, mix up the format as much as possible - \nhave one game be the more standard meeting of the gangs called by the baton to \ndiscuss common objectives, but another be a wild party celebrating a recent victory \n(or the wake of a fallen character or gang). Another game could be an intrigue-laden \nvisit to a nearby Camarilla court staffed by Narrator characters, while yet another \ncould be an exploratory venture into an elder’s recently abandoned haven, etc. Part \nof the charm of playing an anarch is a departure from the same old, same old of the \nsects - \nuse it to your advantage! \nPerhaps you can even work out a schedule of some kind, such as having the baron \ncall a general meeting once every other month, and then allow the actions of the \nplayers to determine what the other sessions will be. Indeed, players whose characters \nroutinely host gatherings for fellow anarchs might gain some Reputation, for \ninstance, as a means of helping promote this way of thinking and encouraging players \nto put together their own gatherings. This allows the players to feel as though their \nactions have a real impact on the nature of the game, and further distances them from \nthe endless Elysium gatherings or tired pack rites of the sects. Just make sure that all \nthe characters have at least some reason to be there-action-oriented characters can \nstill act as bodyguards during more social gatherings, for instance, while more social \ntypes can act as diversions for particularly daring raids. \nFrustration and Boredom \nPlayers of anarch characters can sometimes grow bored with their characters, \nusually because they are frustrated with their inability to make headway against their \nchosen targets, be they Camarilla or Sabbat. This problem is especially common to \nChronicles in which the anarch characters are the decided minority amid a much \nlarger group of Kindred. Players are only human, after all, and as such are much less \npatient than the vampires they are portraying: An anarch character might be willing \nto wait years or even decades to bring a plan to fruition, but her player would like it \nto happen this month. Keep an eye out for players whose anarch characters start off \nstrong on roleplaying but quickly devolve into walking gunslingers, taking potshots \nat any Kindred unlucky enough to stray near them. There’s seldom a clearer \nindication that a player has become bored or frustrated with his character or the story \nthan a sudden shift toward violent in-character behavior. Take a look at the \ncharacter’s goals and think about the scope you’ve established for your game. [s the \ncharacter pursuing achievable goals that are appropriate to your Chronicle? An \nanarch planning to turn his city into the next Free State is probably thinking too big \nfor a sect-based story, and some revision may be in order. \nIf the anarch character’s goals are in line with your story’s scope, resist the \ntemptation to shield her from the consequences of her actions. Anarchs shouldn’t be \nable to get away with murder, literally or figuratively, just because they’re anarchs and \nnot members of a sect. Few things are more frustrating than trying to portray a \nconservative, hard-line Camarilla character and being artificially blocked from \ngiving the local anarchs their just desserts on the grounds that they, too, are player \nCHAPTER \nFIVE: So You WANT A REVOLUTION \n157 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncharacters. This is especially true if the anarchs behave in a fashion that would \ndefinitely result in destruction, were they Narrator characters. Make sure both sides \nknow the rules and limits for their conflicts, both in-game and out, and realize that \nthey will be held equally accountable. \nOne of the Concepts Is Not Like the Others \nDon’t be afraid to say no to a character concept that just doesn’t mesh well with \nthe underlying principles of the Anarch Movement or the overall scheme of your \nChronicle. That’s part of your role as the Storyteller, and your players look to you to \nmake sure all characters are appropriate to the story. While it’s always to the benefit of \nyour Chronicle to think outside the common stereotypes, that doesn’t mean some \nguidelines aren’t helpful and necessary. Characters who are associated with the anarchs \nfirst and foremost need some plausible reason to become affiliated with the Movement. \nWhile logical rationales can run the gamut from a desire to effect genuine social \nchange among the damned to simply seeking new thrills on a Saturday night, some \nmotivations just don’t make sense. ATzimisce isn’t going to voluntarily join up with \nthe Anarch Movement because he just doesn’t have any stake in working toward a \nreformed Camarilla, not to mention the fact that merely considering such a move \nprobably forfeits his unlife in the unforgiving eyes of his clan. The same is true for the \nGiovanni and many Followers of Set: Their respective agendas are progressing just \nfine without the necessity of hooking up with a bunch of social and political outcasts, \nthank you very much. \nLast, be on the lookout for players who confuse “anarch” with “unstoppable \nCaitiff killing machine with wild and crazy Disciplines,” “min-maxed super thug,” or \nany other character with the maximum possible number of advantageous Traits and \nvery little personality to back it up. Such players are likely to try to use these same \nunlikely Trait combinations as part of the reason they joined in the first place - \n“I’m \nan outcast because, uh, I killed a whole lot of people and, um, everybody was jealous \nof my massive studliness” -but \ndon’t let them bully you just because they took the \ntime to write some stats down on paper. Just because a Trait is available in a book \ndoesn’t mean it’s available in your game, especially if it looks like the player has \nchosen it for sheer power as opposed to playing a more interesting character. First and \nforemost, a character must be able to make a positive contribution to the game, \notherwise she doesn’t belong. You should always feel free to deny a concept that’s not \nappropriate to your Chronicle; the long-term benefits of doing so far outweigh the \nshort-term hassle, not least because your other players will thank you for choosing a \ngood story over rote game mechanics. \nTHE ANARCH GIDE \n158 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAPIER FIVE: % YOU WANT A kvoluno~ \n159 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDo you know your place \nIn the big charade? \nAre you more than They? \n- \nBad Religion, “Leaders and Followers” \nPORTRAIT \nGALLFRY \nHere are some sample templates for a spectrum of different anarch characters \nthat you as the Storyteller can use either as quick, ready-made supportin!, \n7 cast \nmembers for an existing game or as pre-generated characters for your players.

Your sire was one of the original \nwealthy rags-to-riches financiers in life, and still fancied himself a great philanthropist \nand philosophical “friend of the common man,” although in truth he was more prone to \narmchair debates about human rights than taking action. Still, as far as you could see the \nothers of your clan were little better than loudmouthed rabble, so you stayed close to your \nsire and were rewarded for your loyal service with a rising star in the Camarilla. However, \nsomething never sat quite right with you about your role. A couple of years after your \nrelease, you went in search of that elusive something you felt was missing from your \nstagnantunlifeand yourdiplomatic dutiesforyourclan. You foundwhat you weremissing \nwhen a firebrand you met at a nightclub told you the truth about Kindred society, After \nfive consecutive nights of deep debate at that same location, you cast your lot with the \nAnarch Movement, to your sire’s eternal shame and frustration. Now you serve the area’s \nanarchs as their loyal emissary to the local court, using your Camarilla connections to \nsmooth over rough incidents and ensure that your brethrenare treated fairly by the prince. \nThat alone keeps you quite busy, but you secretly hope that greater good will come ‘2f the \nendless boons, secrets and mortal contacts - \nthat you might one day inspire another to \nbreak free as you did from the archaic restraints placed upon him by the elders. \nIngratiating x2 \nIntimidation x2, Investigation x3, Leadership, Subterfuge x3, Etiquette x3, Politics x3 \nC H A ~ R  \nSIX: FACES IN THE CROWD \n163 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCHAMFLFON \nClan: Caitiff \nNature: Rebel \nDemeanor: Dabbler \nGeneration: 10th \nPhysical Traits (8) : Quick x2, Tough x2, Agile, Graceful x2, Robust, Delicate (N) \nSocial Traits (10): Eloquent, Gorgeous x2, Churning, C m m d n g x 2 ,  Ingratiating, \nMentalTraits (lZ):Amtiwe, Cratiwex3, Ihsciplinedx2, Insightful, Knowledgeablex2, \nAbilities: Athletics, Expert Ability: Counterfeiting x4, Dodge x2, Melee x2, \nDisciplines: \nDominate: Command, Mesmerism, Forgetful Mind \nObfuscate: Cloak of Shadows, Unseen Presence, Mask of a Thousand Faces \nPresence: Awe, Dread Gaze \nPath: Humanity 3 \nVirtues: Conscience 3, Self Control 4, Courage 3 \nBackgrounds: Allies x3, Resources x3, Herd, Influences: Burammy x3, Churchx2, \nMerits: Daredewil, Personal Masquerade (Malkavian) \nFlaws: Dark Secret (Anarch spy) \nStatus/Reputation: Camarilla: Acknowledged, Cultured, Respected.

As such, you have status, prestige within your clan and two very \nbig - \nand very dangerous -secrets. \nFirst, you are not really a Malkavian, but merely \npassing as one; the real childe of the previous seer was a friend of yours among the \nanarchs who met Final Death at the hands of the Sabbat almost a decade ago. Since \nher sire disappeared mysteriously a few years back, though, it’s unlikely anyone will \nbe able to call your bluff. (Faking insanity isn’t that hard most of the time, especially \nwhen you used to know the model onwhom you’re basing your act.) Besides, the court \nwas happy enough to have its previous advisor’s favored childe return from hiatus to \nfill the void, and you are more than happy to oblige them. Second, you are not a \nCamarilla Kindred, you are an anarch, and have been since your Embrace almost \nthree decades ago. You relish letting the arrogant Camarilla stooges believe they are \npulling your strings, and pretend not to hear when they snicker at the suffering of the \n“poor Lunatic.” You’ve made yourself useful with a combination of pseudo-mystical \npronouncements and cleverly couched information fed to the prince in the guise of \nSeductive x2, Witty, Callous (N) \nRejlectiwe x2, Shrewd \nPerfornunce (Acting) x2, Subterfuge x3, Occult, Politics x2, Intimidation \nHigh Society, Sweet x2, Law x2 \n+\nI\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n164 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n“prophecies” that your fellow revolutionaries are only too happy to help ensure come \nto pass just often enough to keep the court listening to you.

Your sire had witnessed your bloody deed with \nfascinated glee and decided your skills could be put to good use in ridding the \nMovement of undesirables. Turns out he was more right than he knew -after learning \nabout your new unlife, the evils of the sects and the righteousness of the Anarch Revolt, \nyoudecided your sire was just one such impediment to the Cause. Once you ascertained \nhe’d taught you all he could, you eliminated him just as dispassionately as any of your \npast victims. That was years ago, and you’ve done the dirty work for the anarchs ever \nsince. You know what needs to be done and to whom, and are highly effective at \naccomplishing the job. For all the acclaim you receive, you take care never to linger in \none place for long, lest the other anarchs realize just how disturbed you really are and \ntry to get you to change your ways.

Despite \nyour own state as one of the damned, you remain a real people person, and take care \nto ensure that everyone who follows you keeps his nose clean, his language respectful \nand most importantly his eyes open as you carry the message of libertas from city to city. \nIf others are willing to listen, you are willing to tell them who to speak with in your \ngroup.

On the night cf your \nQuinque Ans, you walked back with your girlfriends to your grandmother’s house, \nbut thanks to a roving War Party none of you ever made it there. Only your sheer will \nto survive allowed you to climb through the earth after your Embrace, and combined \nwith your natural adaptability you managed to pull through those first few battles in \none piece, though horribly scarred in the process. No matter what the sect leaders told \nyou, though, you could never stomach the bloodthirsty rhetoric of the Sword of \nCaine. Maybe if they’d given you a choice, you might have come to their side, but \ngiven the slaughter of your friends and your own (carefully hidden) resistance to the \nVaulderie, it was only a matter of time before you rose early one night, torched the \ncommunal haven and fled to the north. Unfortunately, the Sabbat knows you \nsurvived and still hunts you whenever they turn up word of you in a new city, keeping \nyou perpetually on the run. The anarchs offered the only viable alternative to being \non your own, but over time you’ve actually come to embrace many of their ideals - \nyou subscribe to the Anarch Free Press, are an extremely vocal participant in many \nraves and have even helped lead several raiding parties. You hide your pride in your \nskills and your affection for your new friends behind a mask of cool detachment, but \nif things keep going this way for much longer you might eventually mature into one \nhell of a good gang leader. \nROGUE \nWARLOCK \nClan: Tremere \nNature: Thrill-Seeker \nDemeanor: Competitor \nGeneration: 1 1 th \nPhysical Traits (9): Brutal, Enduring, Nimble x2, Quick x2, Steady, Tough x2 \nSocial Traits (10): Alluring x2, Beguiling, Dignified x2, Empathic, Eloquent, \nIngratiating x2, Persuasive, Condescending (N) \nMental Traits (1 1): Alert, Cunning, Knowledgeable x3, Determined, Disciplinczdx3, \nRational x2 \nAbilities: Academics (Theology) x4, Occult x3, Awareness x2, Linguistics x3 \n(Latin, Greek and Hebrew), Medicine, Melee, Science x2, Subterfuge, Dodge x2, \nDisciplines: \nAuspex: Heightened Senses, Aura Perception, Spirit’s Touch, Telepathy \nThaumaturgy: Taste for Blood, Blood Rage, Blood of Potency \nRituals: Deflection of the Wooden Doom, Principal Focus of Vitae Infusion, \nPath: Humanity 3 \nVirtues: Conscience 2, Self Control 3, and Courage 2 \nBackgrounds: Resources x2, Retainers, Influences: Occult x3 \nMerits: Lucky, Oracular Ability \nFlaws: Phobia, Probationary Sect Member \nStatus/Reputation: Committed, Hook-Up \nWake With Evening’s Freshness, Ward Versus Vitae \nCHAPTER SK: FACES IN THE CROWD \n1 69 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBlood: 12 \nWillpower: 4 \nRoleplaying Hints: A rebellious occultist, radical theologian and part-time prophet \nin life, you caught the Warlocks‘ eye early on, and after a suitable period of time you were \napproached for the Embrace. Contrary to the meritocracy you’d been promised, however, \nit took long decades to rise through the pyramid to just a mid-ranking apprentice for your \nlocal chantry. You bided your time, waiting for an opportunity to prove your worth to rise \nto Regent. At last it came, and with no small amount of triumphant glee, you presented \nevidence proving the local Regent had become Blood Bound to an outsider and was giving \norders that violated the Tremere Oath. Unfortunately, you had no idea that the canny old \nRegent had been tracking your movementS for some time.

They mistrust you and you’re fine with that \n- \nafter the experiences you suffered at the hands of your own clan, you can understand why \nthey’re a little skittish. But they seem closer than anyone to establishing the meritocracy \nyou’ve sought throughout life and undeath, and for that kind of goal you’re willing to be \npatient. As it is, they generally leave you alone to do research and only call on you to play \nthe role of the wise occult sage when something strange happens. What troubles you is that, \nwhile certainly more versed in the occult and bizarre than most anarchs, you also learned \njust enough to realize there’s a lot more out there than you understand. That more than \nanything kightens you every time you get a call demanding your “expertise.” \nTHF MI~~TAKF \nClan: Caitiff \nNature: Monster \nDemeanor: Deviant \nGeneration: 13th \nPhysical Traits (8): Agile x2, Tough x2, Tireless, Quick x2, Nimble \nSocial Traits (8): Empathic x2, Expressive, Friendly x2, Seductive, Gorgeous x2, \nEerie (N) \nMental Traits (10): Creative x2, Determined x2, insightful x2, Observant, Wily x2, \nWise, Violent (N) \nAbilities: Athletics, Dodge, Empathy x3, Expression x4, Performance x3, \nDisciplines: \nDementation: Passion \nFortitude: Endurance \nMelpominee: The Missing Voice, Phantom Speaker, Madrigal \nPresence: Awe \nPath: Humanity 3 \ne-\nl \nTHE ANARCH QIDE \n170 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVirtues: Conscience 2, Self Control 3, Courage 4 \nBackgrounds: Allies x2, Fame x2, Resources x2, Herd x2, Mentor \nDerangement: Sadism \nMerits: Bright Aura \nFlaws: Light-Sensitiwe, Sire’s Resentment, Thin Blood \nStatus/Reputation: Committed, Cherry (N) \n, Unenlightened (N) \nBlood: 10 \nWillpower: 2 \nRoleplaying Hints: Lead singer for a struggling dark wave band, you were Embraced \njust a few months ago by a mysterious sire smitten by your otherworldly looks and \nbeautifully discordant vocal style.

You probably would’ve \nbeen destroyed out of sheer nayvet6 had not another fan been watching the whole drama \nfrom afar, a Malkavian anarch who rescued you and taught you what you needed to know \nabout your new unlife.

It seems like \neveryone wants a piece of you now -gigs \nto play, contracts to sign, sessions to record and \nso on, but you love the attention. You’ve even gotten a contract to model for a local \nalternative clothing store; your face is on posters in the shopping malls, which amuses you \nno end. Feeding has never been easier, but the Masquerade is getting more and more \ndifficult, and your mentor keeps telling you it might all have to go soon to avoid bringing \ndown the wrath of the Camarilla. If he only knew what you’ve done to some of your fans \nbehind closed doors, he might try to get your contracts canceled tonight, but what he \ndoesn’t know.. . let’s just say that the rest of the band just thinks you’re taking your \nextreme bloodletting and vampiric “stage persona” too seriously. Gigs and money are \ncoming easier than ever, so if they have questions they’re keeping them to themselves. \nYour lust for aberrant pleasures is getting harder to control, and the justifications far not \nindulging yourself likewise sound more and more artificial as time goes by. Nobody \nsuspects that a “pretty face” like you might be up to the kinds of things you enjoy; indeed, \nmost of your fellow anarchs assume you’re some kind of strutting vampire poser just \nbecause of the music you play.

You were stronger and faster than ever, \nand if the girls still didn’t like you much, so much the worse for the next poor bastard you \nhad to work over. You have a natural talent for physical Disciplines, and picked up a few \ntricks to startle opponents used to Sewer Rats being big and slow. Unlife held a steady \nroutine of shakedowns, face-offs and relocations for you, until one night you were kicking \nback at a biker bar and looking for a fight, and the anarchs approached you. You were \nstronger, but they fought as a team, and in the end they brought you down and beat you \nto the brink of torpor. While you struggled to heal, they launched into the reason why \nthey singled you out. You were being exploited, used by your sire and his so-called allies \nto reinforce the same kind of status quo that had ground down your dreams while you were \nalive. As much as your pride stung at the beating you’d received, you got angrier the more \nyou thought about being little more than acommodity to those who claimed to value your \ntalents. In that moment you realized you were walking down the same path you had when \nyou were alive, only this one would never end - \nat least until your sire sent you against \nsomeone bigger and meaner than you. When you were able, you stormed out of the club \nand killed your sire, then skipped town with the anarchs. Since then you’ve earned aplace \nof some respect; while you know that most still write you off as little more than a thug, \nat least nobody gives you orders anymore.

Then \nsomething went wrong, something to do with another, older vampire wanting what your \ngirlfriend had.

As such, they pride \nthemselves on being above the petty social games of the Camarilla or the savage \ninfighting of the Sabbat, where wars spanning centuries have been waged about \nperceived slights against one’s good name and a single scandal or defeat can spell the \nend of a centuries-old Kindred. However, this is not to say that anarchs don’t play \ngames of their own regarding standing within the Movement and the respect of their \npeers; they just go about it a bit differently than their fellow Kindred do. Unlike the \nsects, an anarch’s Reputation is not based on position, rites or generation- indeed, \neven a ghoul can have a Reputation among the anarchs. Rather, revolutionaries gain \nor lose Reputation by their deeds alone, as judged by their comrades-in-arms. In an \nabstract sense, this should mean that merit and personal achievement on the part of \ndedicated revolutionaries are rewarded without the vicious trappings of conven- \ntional status games. \nIn practice, however, it means that some anarchs spend as much time building \nand defending their Reputations as many sect members spend pursuing Status in \nthe eyes of their peers. They become like inner-city gang lords who mock the \ncountry clubs and society snobbery of the city’s elite, only to turn around and \nviciously destroy those who offer them even the slightest hint of disrespect. Or as \none anarch sage wryly noted: “A lot of the neonates keep using a high school \nmetaphor that depicts us as the rebels and outsiders pitted against the fashionable \nCamarilla in-crowd or the tough Sabbat jocks. They forget that even the outcasts \nstill have a pecking order.” Seeing only the possible gains that come from carving \nout their own niches, these anarchs fail to realize that they are perpetuating the \nsame power games they claim to despise, selling out their principles for the sake of \na name that inspires respect. \nMake no mistake, however - \neven anarchs who pursue such good standing \nwith their peers recognize that it is still fundamentally different from the more \nrigid and codified systems of the sects. When your approval rests in the hands of \nthe mob, however sympathetic that mob may generally be, you’re standing on \nthin ice, and anarchs concerned with their Reputations are well aware of it. \nWhile an anarch’s Reputation may carry throughout the Movement and inspire \nfear or respect in revolutionaries across the country, individuals still suffer no \npenalty whatsoever for ignoring it except whatever punishment the anarch can \nbring down on the upstart. In other words, a Reputation is worth as much pull as \nthe audience wants to give it, so canny anarchs don’t try to ride Reputation alone, \nor they risk losing it quickly. It’s a simple truth: If you abuse your Reputation, you \nwill lose it. \nBut if you can hold on to it.. . such are legends made of. \nTHE ANARCH GJIDE \n174 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n~UTTINGYOUR \nMONFY \nWHPRFYOURMOUTHIS \nREPUTATION \nMECHANICS \nAnarchs can use Reputation Traits in all the same ways as Camarilla or S'abbat \nStatus - \nReputation can be added to Social Challenges, loaned as a favor, etc. - \nwith the following changes. First, other anarchs suffer no penalty for ignoring \nReputation use in a challenge, save whatever punishment the character with \nReputationcan levy for disrespecting her standing in the Movement. (Few dedicated \nrevolutionaries take such slights against their good names lightly, so would-be \nupstarts beware.) Second, anarch Reputation Traits newer apply against Camarilla or \nSabbat vampires, just as Status in those sects never applies against the anarchs. Third, \nalthough an anarch with greater Reputation is more likely to be believed than one \nwith less in a casual setting, Reputation is not the final factor that decides whose word \nis accepted as it is in the sects. All anarchs are considered equal in the eyes of their \nfellows regarding disciplinary proceedings or criminal accusations, or at least, if there \nis corruption in the process, it doesn't lie at the Reputation stage of the proceedings. \nFinally, the normal rules for gaining and losing Status have been changed somewhat. \nAmong the anarchs, clan standing or the whims of hoary old elders do not determine \nCHAPKR Sc FACES IN ME \nCROWD \n175 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nReputation, but rather recognition by one’s fellow revolutionaries for what a \ncharacter has achieved (or failed to achieve). See the section below for how to handle \ngains and losses among this volatile group. \nSee Laws of the Night, page 216, for more details on common uses for \nReputation and how to apply this valuable commodity in vampire society. \nGAINING \nAND LOSING \nREPUTATION \nTemporary Reputation Change \nLosing or gaining temporary ReputationTraits is incredibly easy. All it takes to \naward or remove a temporary Reputation Trait is a majority vote of the anarchs \npresent at any particular gathering, not including the character in question. (Thus, \na solitary anarch cannot vote himself into a great deal of Reputation in this manner, \nsince it is intended to indicate the current “buzz” of the local anarch community.) \nThis informal vote can be conducted at any time during the evening, or even on \nmultiple occasions during particularly wild or unpredictable nights. A character still \nmay not gain more temporary Reputation than twice the number of permanent \nReputation Traits she has in this fashion (including Committed) - \neven a burst of \napproval from one’s peers is not enough to truly radically alter a character’s standing. \nHowever, anarchs who routinely receive a lot of positive temporary Reputation in \nthis fashion are often leading candidates to receive more permanent Reputation \nawards at the next big rave. Exactly how often such changes take place depends on \nthe anarchs inquestion-some \nmore stable gangs seldom call suchvotes, while more \npolitical packs may call for these votes constantly. In the end, the anarchs themselves \ndecide when such opinion polls are necessary. \nSystem: Any time during a session that a majority of the anarch characters \npresent (not necessarily the majority of the anarchs in the game as a whole) are \nassembled, they may call a vote to award or remove temporary ReputationTraits from \nany anarch present. Once the matter has been discussed to the group’s satisfaction, \na vote is called: on a count of three, everyone with the CommittedTrait holds thumbs \nup if in favor of the change, thumbs down if opposed or a plain fist if abstaining. A \nsimple majority wins. There are no appeals for these changes, save to attempt to call \nanother vote later on to reverse the decision. To call each such “appeal” vote costs \none temporary Reputation Trait, however, so wise anarchs know when popular \nopinion has shifted against them and don’t further squander their good names trying \nto win back respect. Unless otherwise noted or agreed upon by the Storyteller and the \ntroupe, temporary Reputation shifts arising from these informal votes last only until \nthe end of the session. \nEven in this informal forum, an anarch must demonstrate some basis for \ndeserving an increase or decrease in temporary Reputation -players \ncannot simply \nstand in a circle and award each other temporary Reputation up to their maximums. \nThose who attempt to do so should be severely reprimanded, or else the spirit of the \nsystem and the balance of the game will be thrown out of alignment. As Reputation \nis still handled through the Storyteller or the Gossip (if the game has one), this \nshouldn’t be an issue, but should a question arise a troupe may make it a policy that \nTHE ANARCH \nGUIDL \n176 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\none of those staff figures must be present at all changes in temporary Reputation in \norder to ensure the system is being handled fairly. \nPermanent Reputation Change \nTo initiate any kind of permanent Reputation change, a full-fledged anarch \ngathering must be under way, and a character other than the one seeking newfound \nrespect (or deserving censure) must first propose that the selected character g:ain or \nlose the Trait in question. At truly large, contentious or rowdy gatherings the \nStoryteller may require that the speaker spend a temporary Reputation Trait in order \nto get the crowd’s attention; failure means they simply don’t pay enough attention \nto the character for her to call a proper vote. This process can take some time if the \ncrowd has questions or if they attempt to drown out the speaker, and may require a \nSocial Test or two to decide in the event of evenly matched opposition. \nProvided the speaker can get the crowd to listen, the would-be recipient’s \nactions are recounted and voted on as to whether or not they are deserving of the \nReputation Trait in question. Likewise, to remove an accolade or assign a negative \nReputation Trait, someone must propose the need for punishment and relate the \nreason(s) why she feels the accused character does not deserve to be known as \nHardcore any longer, for example. \nRemember that a proper anarch gathering, as defined by the city’s anarchs \nthemselves (formally or otherwise), is always required in order to call votes that carry \npermanent weight. It is also usually required that most if not all of the city’s active \nanarchs be present to provide a properly representative body, though this can vary \nin times of emergency or other dire need. Barring truly exceptional circumstances, \nan anarch may not gain more than one permanent positive Reputation Trait per rave, \nthough he may lose as many positive or gain as many negative Reputation Traits as \nhis fellow anarchs see fit. \nSystem: Assuming the speaker can get the word out, a vote is called to represent \nwhether or not the assembled anarchs feel the change is justified. The voting process \nis simple - \non a count of three, each character with the Committed Trait holds \nthumbs up for “yes,” thumbs down for “no” or a plain fist for “abstain.” When \nremoving an existing positive Reputation Trait or assigning a negative Reputation \nTrait, a simple majority carries, while awarding a new positive Trait requires a 2/3 \nmajority approval - \nit’s a lot easier to lose respect than gain it, after all. Removing \na negative Reputation Trait is described in the section relating to these Traits. Even \nghouls can gain or lose Reputation at a rave, though generally speaking they must \naccomplish at least twice as much as a vampire would in order to be eligible for the \nsame Trait. If the vote passes, the Reputation Trait is awarded immediately, and \ncannot be removed until at least the next gathering, barring evidence of fra.ud or \nblame being placed unfairly on a target. \nNote that this is not necessarily or even usually considered an actual in-game \nhand-raising vote, though some anarch groups might well decide to make it one. \nRather, it is intended as an out-of-game mechanic to determine whether the crowd \nis sufficiently swayed or not. However, the vote is not entirely anonymous either - \nCHAPTER \nSIX: FACES IN ME CROW \nI77 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngiven the passionate nature of these debates, whether a character was for or against \na particular vote is considered plainly noticeable by all characters present, barring \nDiscipline use or a similar talent for masking one’s true feelings. Characters who wish \nto hide their feelings in this manner may spend a level of Subterfuge or activate an \nappropriate concealment power, and then indicate this concealment by cupping the \nother hand around the one used for the vote in order to obscure it to all save the \nperson doing the tallying. Those wishing to determine the true opinions of such \ncharacters must first defeat them individually in a standard Social test (retest \nEmpathy); success means a character can tell how the target’s vote was cast. \nOtherwise a character should roleplay her inability to judge how that character felt, \nregardless of whether the player could tell how the vote went out-of-game. \nExample of Play: Shane takes the stage at an anarch rave and describes how he feels \nhis packmate Daron deserves to gain the Hardcore Reputation Trait for chasing a hated \nCamarilla elder into a burning grove to ensure that he did not escape, despite already being \ngravely wounded herself. Swayed by the heroic deed and Shane’s convincing rhetoric, the \ncrowd votes and Daron receives a favorable 213 majority. Her new Hardcore Reputation \nTrait is immediately awarded. Later on, Daron herself stands before the crowdanddescribes \nhow her fellow packmate Dracos deserves the Casualty negative Reputation Trait after he \nnearly got hisgangkilled by not watchinghis backduringacriticalphase ofthat sameassault. \nDracos angrily responds that it wasn’t his fault, that Daron had been overconfident and too \nquick to attack, and the debate rages for several minutes before a clear vote can finally be \ncalled. Despite some dissension, the majority votes against Dracos, and he immediately \nreceives the Casualty negative Reputation Trait. However, no one spent Subterfuge or \notherwise concealed their voting either, so Dracos also has a good idea of who voted against \nhim and can factor that into future dealings with his gang members. Looks like there’s some \ntension brewing in this gang.. . . \nBoons and Prestation \nAlthough the anarchs do not recognize formal “boons” or follow the same \nantiquated rules of “prestation” that other vampires slavishly adhere to, that doesn’t \nmean the concepts those terms represent are entirely alien to them. Indeed, since \n+\nI\nTHE ANARCH GUIDE \n178 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthey often have little more than the favors and goodwill of their fellow revolution- \naries to rely on out in the field, most anarchs keep careful track of what they’re due \nand what they owe. Failure to repay an important favor has been the flashpoint for \nmore than one bloody conflict in the Movement, and making good on your debts and \ncollecting on what others owe you is a large part of maintaining one’s Reputation. \nHere’s the trickypart: The fluid and highly subjective natureofanarchReput ation \nmeans that to really maintain it well, you must act like you don’t care about it. \nAttempting to enforce your superior “standing” with an iron fist is bound to fail in the \nlong term- as soon as you become known for trying to get by on your celebrity or being \nan absolute bully about demanding repayment for debts others owe you, a nasty \nbacklash is sure to crop up. Anarchs may love a hero, but they hate a tyrant more. The \nmore overtly an anarch seeks Reputation, the less chance he has of finding it. \nConversely, the less outwardly concerned he is with his “rep,” the more likely he is to \nreceive one from his peers. It’s a strange cycle, but true in practice nevertheless,. \nWhen dealing with the anarchs and such delicate matters as debts and prestation, \nthen, the difference is primarily one of style and subtlety- though they would be loath \nto admit it, anarchs essentially respect many of the same rules concerning repaying \ndebts and paying proper respect. They just approach it differently than other vampires \ndo. While a Camarilla prince might speak of a “life boon” or formally announce that \nhe is calling in “a prestation debt” to gather support for his latest project, an anarch \nwould handle the matter much more casually - \nbut no less seriously. She might remind \nher friend of the time she stuck her neck out for him, and implore him to pay her back \nwith an equal display of friendship; the words and the approach are different, but the \nmeaning is essentially the same as honoring a “life boon.” Likewise, an anarch looking \nto make a play for baron of the local territory might remind her ally of the time she stood \nup for him during a rave where his Reputation was taking a beating, and ask him to \nthrow his support behind her during her current campaign. While neither would admit \nit, this is essentially the same as a “prestation debt.” \nOnce again, it’s all aquestionofstyle- how toremind others ofyourstation or what \nthey owe you without calling too much attention to the fact that you are doing so. It’s a \ntrick that can take centuries to master, but it’s vital for any anarchs who seek to build a \nlasting Reputation among their kind. Players and Storytellers are thus encouraged to \nreward players who make an effort to understand and embrace the uniquely anarch style \nof handling boons and prestation, while at the same time discouraging other player:; who \ntry to handle it as simply the Camarilla Status system with a nose ring. \nRFPUTATION \nTRAITS \nAn anarch can generally have up to eight Reputation Traits, subject to Storyteller \ndiscretion. Areas with a higher concentration of anarchs tend to allow for more \nvariation in Reputation levels, reflecting the developing hierarchy of the local \nrevolutionaries and the potential for greater advancement with the presence of a larger \npower base. By contrast, a city with only a handful of anarchs is likely to be limited to \nfewer Reputation Traits, since unless their exploits become particularly legendary - \nor infamous - \nthey are unlikely to attract the kind of acclaim awarded to radicals in \nCHAPTER SUC: FACES IN MI CROW \n179 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmore established cities. In either case an anarch‘s Reputation can still come and go far \nmore rapidly than in the Camarilla or even in the Sabbat, as outlined above. \nSince the anarchs recognize no formal offices as such - even the most \nprestigious baron still technically occupies an unofficial post - \nthe only way to earn \nReputation is to become known for a particular accomplishment or talent. While it \nis theoretically possible to lie about one’s deeds to gain Reputation, doing so is rarely \nanything but an invitation to disaster when one’s true past is eventually revealed. \nThe possible reward is just not worth the potential consequences, as most such liars \nand frauds quickly discover to their dismay. While anarchs may not be as formal about \nReputation as their sect counterparts, that doesn’t mean they enjoy being lied to any \nmore than anyone else does, especially by their “comrades.” \nIn addition to the standard Status Traits provided in Laws of the Night (many \nof which can just as easily apply to anarchs, especially more “established” types such \nas barons or emissaries), some important new Traits include: \nAdvocate, Believer, Champion, Preacher. These degrees of Reputation recog- \nnize how well known an anarch is for teaching independent or sect-aligned vampires \nabout the true ideals of the Anarch Revolt, gathering recruits or defusing tensions \nborn of misunderstanding. \nBond/Bond Girl. The anarch is a successful spy within one of the larger sects, \nwhether a simple observer or actively working to undermine it from within. \nCommitted. The vampire has proven her dedication to the ideals of the Anarch \nRevolt as well as her loyalty to her fellow anarchs after a suitable probationary period \nand/or trial by fire. Once received, this Trait cannot be removed short of the holder’s \ndecision to leave the Movement or being permanently banished from the ranks of the \nanarchs as a result of betrayal, chronic incompetence, etc. \nHardcore. The anarch has gone above and beyond the call of duty and placed \nherself directly in harm’s way in order to complete a mission of great importance to \nthe Movement even in the face of superior odds, serious personal objections, grave \ndanger of Final Death or other overwhelming factors. \nLoaded, Hmk-Up, Connected. The anarch is well knownas atrusted source ofnecessary \nresources: money and equipment, information or Influence-based favors, respectively. \nMarked. Through her actions in pursuit of the goals of the Movement, the \nanarch has become the target of a Blood Hunt, War Party or even placed on the \ninfamous Red List. This may be a negative Reputation Trait in areas where the \nanarchs are trying to keep a low profile. \nSoldier, Warrior, Veteran, Lifer. Each time an anarch survives a protracted \nsiege, pitched battle or similar major tactical undertaking-not just araid or a minor \nbrawl - \nshe receives one of these Traits. Additional victories beyond this number \nsimply increase the degree of respect granted. \nTested. An anarch who has survived a successful planned raid or similar \norganized minor conflict may receive this Trait. It is only received once, after the first \nsuch clash the vampire survives; after that the anarch is expected to know how to take \ncare of himself in such situations. \nTHE ANARCH \n&]DE \n180 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTrue Believer. The anarch has gone above and beyond the call of duty to \ndirectly place himself in harm’s way for the sake of spreading the ideals of the Anarch \nRevolt. Most often given to recruiters and emissaries who risk Final Death to spread \nthe ideals of the Movement in actively hostile cities. \nVisionary. The anarch has become known for proposing new and useful ideas \nrelated to the Cause, whether a more amicable way to divide hunting grounds \nbetween a city’s gangs, a better method to gather Influence in local government or \na tactical plan that saved the city from a Sabbat invasion. \nStorytellers should feel free to define more Reputation Traits that apply to a \nparticular gang, territory or even to the Movement as a whole. Make the Reputation \nin your chronicle match the style of the anarchs represented as well as the raves and \noverall theme you are looking to create. \nThe anarchs also define a number of standard negative Reputation Traits. (As \nwith positive Reputation Traits, feel free to add more that suit your chronicle.) An \nanarch member may possess two of these at any given moment. Recently awarded \nnegative Traits displace older ones as far as game mechanics go, though that doesn’t \nmean the anarchs have forgotten past indiscretions - \ntheir ire is simply focused in \nanother direction at the moment. Generally speaking, a vampire can earn the \nremoval of the Trait by twice successfully completing whatever task he failed at to \nearn the negative Trait in the first place, or by publicly and conclusively clearing his \nname in the matter of a false accusation. \nBurnt Out. This Trait goes to anarchs who have demonstrated a distinct: lack \nof enthusiasm for the Cause, as well as those who have been heard to belittle or \notherwise downplay the importance of the Anarch Revolt in general. \nCasualty. The anarch has become careless, whether in word or deed, and in \nso doing placed fellow revolutionaries in direct danger. The not-so-subtle implica- \ntion is that if the anarch doesn’t shape up soon, no one will back him the next time \nhe is under fire. \nCherry. This Trait goes to anarchs who exhibit a dangerous nayvet6 ab0u.t the \nMovement, their gang’s goals or even just unlife in general. That said, only the most \nmilitant packs generally give this Trait just for being new to the Cause; most of the \ntime a vampire’s inexperience has to have caused serious problems or even bodily \nharm to fellow anarchs before this Trait applies. \nDefeated. The anarch recently lost a battle. This does not generally apply to \nsituations where the only sane response would be to take flight, such as one anarch \nfacing a horde of Sabbat, but does apply to any fair fights the anarch lost. This also \napplies to anarchs who lose a personal duel. \nOverzealous. The vampire’s refusal to compromise personal beliefs (generally \nhypocritical self-important ones) has led her to needlessly endanger the welfare of \nother anarchs or even the city as a whole. \nThug. Simply put, the anarch is too eager to start a fight or otherwise put \nhimself (and often others) directly at risk, even when it’s not the best option \navailable. Use your fists instead of your wits too often, and this Trait will find you. \nCHAPTER Sn FACE IN ME CROWD \n181 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nUnenlightened. Even after having them explained to her, the anarch cannot \nremember the details of essential components of the Anarch Revolt, such as the \nhistory of the Cause, the importance of the Convention of Thorns, the principles of \nthe Status Perfectus and so on. Usually awarded to an anarch who publicly \ndemonstrates such ignorance, especially in front of members of the sects. \nUnreliable. The vampire failed to perform some key duty for his gang, generally \none that was explicitly outlined in the past and which the anarch is well aware it is \nhis responsibility to fulfill. \nVain (also known as Cocky, Full of Himself or comparable terms). The vampire \nclaims mastery of some field in which she goes on to fail publicly, preferably in an \nimpressive or even physically dangerous way. This Trait commemorates acts of \nunsuccessful hubris of all kinds. \nKEEPING \nREPUTATION \nIN PFRSPECTIVF \nAlways remember that Reputation Traits quantify something that’s hazy and \nsubjective to characters in the World of Darkness. Reputation is fluid, personalized \nand subject to change without muchnotice. A character can ride avictory to the top \nof the world one night, only to find the backlash surrounding his next failure that \nmuch more intense since he has become a figure of public renown and the others \n“expected better” of him. Players should acknowledge the natural give-and- take of \nthis system and take all gains and losses in stride, as well as recognize that just because \nthe other characters voted to give them a negative Reputation Trait, that doesn’t \nmean the other players have it in for them. As long as they keep that distinction in \nmind, most troupes can run the rough-and-tumble majority rule system presented \nhere without a problem. \nHowever, if it starts becoming an out-of-game popularity contest or causing \nharsh feelings between players who feel they’re being passed over for Reputation or \nunfairly assignednegativeTraits, change it. There are more anarchsout there than just \nthe players’ characters, after all, and as such you’re perfectly entitled to rule that the \nlarger anarch population (i.e. you the Storyteller) is the final arbiter of all Reputation \nadjustments. Or you may come up with an entirely different method of tracking \nReputation unique to your game: So long as you and your players enjoy it, that’s what \nmatters. The bottom line is that the reality of Reputation - \nsuperior and inferior \nrank, as well as recognition of brilliant or foolish deeds - \nexists even among the \nsupposedly egalitarian anarchs, and you can portray it in lots of ways. Rules should \nalways serve the chronicle, not the other way around. \nTHE ANARCH \nG~IDE \n182 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"
