  "biography": "Embraced in 1914 at the age of 28, Cordelia Fairchild was a socialite and art critic during the height of the American Gilded Age’s decline. Her Embrace came from a Toreador enamored with her ability to destroy reputations with a single whispered review. For decades she moved through Arizona’s small but decadent Kindred society, first establishing herself in Flagstaff, where she cultivated influence through the city’s business elite and railroad-connected families. By the late 1940s, she had relocated to Phoenix, bringing her mortal and Kindred contacts with her. Her rise was inevitable: by the 1950s she was recognized as the Harpy of the domain, her wit and cruelty wrapped in honeyed civility. In 1960, she orchestrated the social destruction of Darrell Buyers, a Nosferatu elder who once controlled the city’s mortal political machine. The scandal ended his influence and solidified Cordelia’s supremacy. She remains the Harpy to this night, as elegant as she is terrifying, a living reminder that in the Jyhad of whispers, words kill faster than blades.",
