  "biography": "Born 1970 in wealthy Ontario family with twin sister Sabine. Parents died when they were 15 (mysterious circumstances, trust fund established). Aunt took custody but let them do what they wanted - they chose art galleries, high society parties, and modeling. Inseparable their entire lives - people who knew them thought 'if one dies, the other will follow.' A female Toreador in Ontario fell in love with them at a party and wanted to Embrace both, but couldn't get permission from her Prince. She contacted old friend (Phoenix Toreador Primogen), introduced the twins at a big party. The Primogen became obsessed - saw them as living works of art, a matched set that cannot be separated. Embraced both in 1992 (age 22). Served as Talons to Harpy Cordelia Prescott since Embrace, learning Kindred social politics. Part of Primogen's long-term plan to eventually take over New York Kindred society. Never seen apart from Sabine - literally no one has a memory of them separated. They are beautiful but deeply unsettling, projecting raw sexual energy that can be frightening.",
