# Ability Specializations

Special Abilities with Mandatory Specializations
Some Abilities require a specialization regardless of dot level:
Art
Expression
Crafts
Performance
Pilot
Academics
Area Knowledge
Esoterica
Science
Important: For these Abilities, if you have fewer than 4 dots, the specialization is required but does NOT grant the +1 bonus. You only get the +1 bonus once you reach 4+ dots.
Multiple Specializations
Allowed: Characters can have multiple specializations in the same Ability
Cost:
During character creation: 1 freebie point each (after the first)
With experience: 4 XP each (after the first)
No stacking: Multiple specializations that apply in the same situation don't stackâ€”you only get +1 total
Attributes: Generally limited to one specialization per Attribute (unlike Abilities)
This system allows characters to develop deep expertise in specific areas that align with their character concept and background.
