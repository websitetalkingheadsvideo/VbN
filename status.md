### Current Status: Database Save Functionality Debugging

**Problem**: Character save functionality is not working. When users click the save button, they get "❌ JSON Parse Error: Unexpected end of JSON input" because the save script returns empty output instead of JSON.

**What We've Confirmed**:
- ✅ XAMPP Apache and MySQL are running properly
- ✅ Database connection works
- ✅ Basic character inserts work (tested manually)
- ✅ JSON data is being received correctly by save script (confirmed in error logs)
- ✅ No database locks or long-running queries
- ✅ All required database tables exist

**What's Failing**:
- The save script (`save_character.php`) hangs after logging the received data
- Even the simplified save script (`save_character_simple.php`) returns empty output
- Even basic tests without transactions are hanging

**Key Files**:
- `save_character.php` - Main save script (hangs after logging)
- `save_character_simple.php` - Simplified version (also returns empty)
- `test_save_button.html` - Frontend test page
- Error logs show data is received but script never responds

**Next Steps**:
1. **Check PHP error logs** for fatal errors that might be causing the hang
2. **Test with a minimal save script** that only does the basic insert
3. **Check if there's a PHP timeout or memory limit issue**
4. **Consider if there's a session or include issue** causing the hang
5. **Test the save script directly via command line** to isolate the issue

**Files to Focus On**:
- `save_character.php` - Main save script
- `includes/connect.php` - Database connection
- PHP error logs in `C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log`

The core database operations work, but something in the save script execution is causing it to hang and return empty output instead of JSON.
